  abstract={Neurofeedback therapies based on brain-computer interfaces (BCI) can be used for the rehabilitation of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as an alternative to conventional treatments. In this paper the design, implementation and preliminary evaluation of Attenti-ON, a hybrid BCI for ADHD rehabilitation, is presented. Attenti-ON uses a Serious Game commanded by the level of attention estimated by the theta/beta ratio of the electroencephalogram as a neurofeedback and also incorporates a manual activity that focuses attention on the required cognitive task., Attenti-ON consists of an user interface and four modules: the first one acquires the electroencephalography signals from prefrontal electrodes, located at Fp1 and Fp2, and conditions them. The second module procceses the signals and generates a valid command for the third module which consists in the Serious Game, developed in Unity. In this module the speed of an animated avatar is modified by the level of attention. The last module is the manual control consisting of a keyboard or joystick. Two evaluations of Attenti-ON were conducted. The first one was to assess the systems operation by using a signals database. In the second one, the BCIs closed loop-performance on a healthy volunteer was evaluated and aimed at verifying that the speed of the avatar varied according to the level of attention of the volunteer, which was modified by simulated interference situations. These preliminary results suggest that Attenti-ON could be transfered to the clinical setting for its evaluation for the treatment of ADHD.},

  volume={32},

  pages={2847-2861},
  abstract={With the increasing prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it is important to identify ASD patients for effective treatment and intervention, especially in early childhood. Neuroimaging techniques have been used to characterize the complex biomarkers based on the functional connectivity anomalies in the ASD. However, the diagnosis of ASD still adopts the symptom-based criteria by clinical observation. The existing computational models tend to achieve unreliable diagnostic classification on the large-scale aggregated data sets. In this work, we propose a novel graph-based classification model using the deep belief network (DBN) and the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database, which is a worldwide multisite functional and structural brain imaging data aggregation. The remarkable connectivity features are selected through a graph extension of  ${K}$ -nearest neighbors and then refined by a restricted path-based depth-first search algorithm. Thanks to the feature reduction, lower computational complexity could contribute to the shortening of the training time. The automatic hyperparameter-tuning technique is introduced to optimize the hyperparameters of the DBN by exploring the potential parameter space. The simulation experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model, which is 6.4% higher than the best result reported on the ABIDE database. We also propose to use the data augmentation and the oversampling technique to identify further the possible subtypes within the ASD. The interpretability of our model enables the identification of the most remarkable autistic neural correlation patterns from the data-driven outcomes.},

  abstract={Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), categorized by the lack of attention and focus, is one of the most common cognitive disorders. Since electroencephalogram (EEG) signals carry wide-ranging insights about cognition skills, the potential of using EEG signals to detect ADHD has a significant potential. EEG can be recorded utilizing wireless EEG reading devices often used by brain-computer interface researchers. In parallel-to-affordable EEG devices, serious games have been recently employed in the rehabilitation of multiple cognitive deficits. In this paper, we put the two things together, and we investigate the integration of an EEG-controlled serious game that trains and strengthens patients' attention ability while using machine learning to detect their attention level. Our pilot experiments with healthy individuals show an accuracy of up to 96% in classifying the EEG data to detect the correct game control type during gameplay, while our extended experiments with ADHD patients show an accuracy of up to 98% with a standard uncertainty of 0.16% in detecting ADHD patients.},

  abstract={A challenge for serious games designers is to integrate learning with entertainment. For this purpose, the generation of curiosity using the foreshadowing/back story technique is promising. To implement this technique we propose the Game Discourse Analysis (GDA) which discerns between information flow (i.e. the sequence of information elements in a chronological order) and game discourse (i.e. the manipulation of the information flow to make the game more engaging and effective). We elaborate on the GDA and describe how two of the authors applied it in order to implement foreshadowing/back story in the game ReMission. The GDA was found to have potential as a communication tool for multidisciplinary design teams. Also, two problems were signaled: (1) creating an information flow is laborious and designers may benefit from automating parts of the GDA; (2) substantial deviations from the optimal information flow by players’ actions may interfere with the intention of the game discourse. Additionally, in an experiment we tested the impact of this GDA supported manipulation on engagement (curiosity) and learning. We found that the GDA-supported foreshadowing/back story yielded more curiosity, but that it did not yield learning.},

  abstract={Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) methods and technologies, designed to support the self-report of experience in the moment of daily life, have long been considered poised to revolutionize human-centred research, the practice of design and mental healthcare. The history of EMA is inextricably linked to technology, and mobile devices embody many of the characteristics required to support these methods. However, significant barriers to the design and adoption of these systems remain, including challenges of user engagement, reporting burden, data validity and honest disclosure. While prior research has examined the feasibility of a variety of EMA systems, few reviews have attended to their design. Through inter-disciplinary narrative literature review (n = 342), this paper presents a characterization of the EMA technology design space, drawing upon a diverse set of literatures, contexts, applications and demographic groups. This paper describes the options and strategies available to the EMA systems designer, with an eye towards supporting the design and deployment of EMA technologies for research and clinical practice.},

  pages={1-11},
  abstract={Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a persistent condition with repeated issues, such as difficulty maintaining attention, impetuous behavior, and hyperactivity. It severely impacts a considerable population of children. Therefore, it is crucial to focus on early detection and treatment of ADHD. Few recent studies utilize electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements acquired during distinct cognitive graphics along with machine learning and deep learning for its detection. However, such studies are limited with the availability of only two public EEG measurement datasets to date. In view of these aspects, this work proposes a deep learning-based unified framework for the detection of ADHD and its real-time deployment on smartphones. Extensive performance assessment with the average accuracies of 99.02% and 98.60% for EEG measurements in two public datasets suggests that the proposed approach can be more accurate than those of prior studies in some cases. Robustness analysis using inter-dataset signals further demonstrates the effectiveness and cost efficiency of the proposed framework. The framework predicts ADHD/non-ADHD signals on smartphone with a latency of 67 ms and utilizes an overall energy of 82.50 mWh for processing EEG measurements, detecting ADHD/non-ADHD and communicating these details to the medical server. This demonstrates its feasibility in real-time environment with the facility of tracking ADHD progression by subjects toward self-assessment, thereby decreasing the transportation cost of frequent clinical sessions.},

  pages={10591-10605},
  abstract={Neuroimaging techniques have been widely adopted to detect the neurological brain structures and functions of the nervous system. As an effective noninvasive neuroimaging technique, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been extensively used in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of mental disorders, e.g., autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In this study, we propose a spatial–temporal co-attention learning (STCAL) model for diagnosing ASD and ADHD from fMRI data. In particular, a guided co-attention (GCA) module is developed to model the intermodal interactions of spatial and temporal signal patterns. A novel sliding cluster attention module is designed to address global feature dependency of self-attention mechanism in fMRI time series. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our STCAL model can achieve competitive accuracies of 73.0 ± 4.5%, 72.0 ± 3.8%, and 72.5 ± 4.2% on the ABIDE I, ABIDE II, and ADHD-200 datasets, respectively. Moreover, the potential for feature pruning based on the co-attention scores is validated by the simulation experiment. The clinical interpretation analysis of STCAL can allow medical professionals to concentrate on the discriminative regions of interest and key time frames from fMRI data.},

  abstract={Inclusion of game elements in health education has proved to be effective in helping student training. Commonly termed as “serious games” these gamified systems can be an alternative to empower and motivate students during the learning process. The literature contains serious games for professional training in many health-related areas, including several motivating and playful gamification elements, and a variety of evaluation techniques used. Some review studies have compiled articles that present serious games for health-related areas analyzing aspects such as development methodologies and assessment techniques. However, the playful aspects that contribute to the health education process have not yet been compiled. This article focuses on a systematic review that analyzes the state of the art regarding serious games for health-related education, and evaluates the following: 1) game elements; 2) platforms, evaluation methods; and 3) requirements analysis methods. The findings indicate that “Tasks,” “Score,” and “Level Progression” were the most used gamification elements. Physiotherapy, psychology, and physical education were the areas most covered by the included articles. Pre and posttest questionnaires were identified as the main methods used to evaluate the serious games. The article contributes with an overview of the serious games design process, abstracted from the performed review and depicted in a diagram showing the phases commonly found in our study. The article also proposes a categorization for the most used game elements and evaluation methods.},

  abstract={Facing the increasing worldwide prevalence of mental disorders, the symptom-based diagnostic criteria struggle to address the urgent public health concern due to the global shortfall in well-qualified professionals. Thanks to the recent advances in neuroimaging techniques, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has surfaced as a new solution to characterize neuropathological biomarkers for detecting functional connectivity (FC) anomalies in mental disorders. However, the existing computer-aided diagnosis models for fMRI analysis suffer from unstable performance on large datasets. To address this issue, we propose an efficient multitask learning (MTL) framework for joint diagnosis of multiple mental disorders using resting-state fMRI data. A novel multiobjective evolutionary clustering algorithm is presented to group regions of interests (ROIs) into different clusters for FC pattern analysis. On the optimal clustering solution, the multicluster multigate mixture-of-expert model is used for the final classification by capturing the highly consistent feature patterns among related diagnostic tasks. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the performance of the proposed framework is superior to that of the other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the potential for practical application of the framework is also validated in terms of limited computational resources, real-time analysis, and insufficient training data. The proposed model can identify the remarkable interpretative biomarkers associated with specific mental disorders for clinical interpretation analysis.},

  pages={112175-112188},
  abstract={Neurofeedback can be utilized to treat various neuropsychiatric disorders in children. However, therapists primarily set threshold values for neurofeedback training. Thus, the training effect becomes subjective owing to the experience of the therapist. A clinically inexperienced therapist could set inappropriate thresholds, rendering the training ineffective. In this study, an effective neurofeedback system that includes signal processing of large amount of electroencephalogram (EEG) data and auto thresholding and provides various training contents was developed. The system uses a method that determines optimal threshold values, which are significant for an effective neurofeedback system. The success or failure of the activation and inhibition of specific EEG frequencies was determined based on these threshold values. The system determined an optimal threshold value to obtain the target success rate using a numerical optimization technique. The success or failure feedback for the reward and inhibit EEG frequencies was generated using auto thresholding. This feedback was sent to the training contents by the inter-process communication module to control the contents. Most training content was implemented as serious video games by using a commercial game engine. Success feedback on reward EEG frequency leads to game progress. By contrast, failure feedback on inhibiting EEG frequency hinders game progress. Consequently, the user gains the self-regulation ability to enhance the reward EEG frequency and suppress the inhibit EEG frequency. A pilot study involving five children with attention deficiency was conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed system. The results demonstrated that the childrent’s attention improved after neurofeedback training.},

  abstract={The gaming industry plays a crucial role in the realm of entertainment within our society. However, from Monopoly to Flight Simulators, serious games have also been appealing tools for learning a new language, conveying values, or training skills. The resurgence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data science in the last decade presents a unique window of opportunity for its integration into video games. This integration is of particular interest due to the vast amount of data that can be collected through a game, which is needed to feed the AI algorithms. This paper aims to identify relevant research paths in the intersection of serious games, AI, and computational social science, particularly in their utilization as novel research tools to comprehend human behavior and society. To provide a comprehensive context, we also present an overview of the serious game research field identifying the most prominent application areas and analyzing applications of AI in serious games that hold great potential for computational social science research. The goal of our work is to establish a valuable framework for researchers interested in utilizing serious games as a novel tool for AI-supported social research.},

  pages={813-822},
  abstract={Providing personalized behavioral information as feedback to drivers can lead to safer practices. However, feedback efficacy is likely moderated by the driver's level of motivation towards behavioral change. Gamification of feedback, which is the incorporation of game design elements intended to motivate drivers toward safe behaviors, could potentially reduce unsafe behaviors in the long term. This article assesses a gamified driver feedback design in mitigating driver distraction and enhancing driving performance among younger drivers. A driving simulator study was conducted with 42 drivers, 21–30 years old, comparing: 1) no feedback; 2) real-time feedback; 3) real-time feedback + postdrive feedback; and 4) real-time feedback + postdrive feedback + game design elements to examine their impact on distraction engagement (manual-visual interactions with an in-vehicle display) and driving performance. Groups that received postdrive feedback, both with and without gamification elements, showed reduced distraction engagement and enhanced driving performance compared to no feedback. Between the two types of postdrive feedback, the nongamified feedback provided more benefits in reducing the 95th percentile glance duration to the in-vehicle display, and the one with gamification provided more benefits in reducing the rate of manual interactions with the in-vehicle display. Meanwhile, no benefits were observed with the real-time feedback only condition over no feedback. Despite minor differences in efficacy, both postdrive and gamification feedback appear to be effective countermeasures for distracted driving in the short term. Future research should investigate other game designs for driver feedback and assess the impact of feedback gamification over longer-term exposure.},

  abstract={Serious Games are games that aid in the process of training or learning content and skills. Numerous studies have reported the positive impact of serious games on the learning process for individuals with autism. However, many of these games do not utilize techniques known to be effective when teaching this specific audience, such as those based on Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). ABA is a behavioral science approach that employs error-free, intensive, and individualized teaching methods, with the goal of promoting independence in the individual. Therefore, this article focuses on incorporating ABA elements into serious games for this target audience, by introducing a Game Design Document (GDD) model that encompasses a set of learning characteristics based on ABA principles. The aim is to provide guidance to designers take these characteristics into consideration in the development of serious games. To validate the model, we conducted two surveys: one involving 15 ABA therapists to validate the ABA characteristics, and another involving 18 game developers to validate the information and organization of the GDD itself. The evaluation results demonstrate that the created model contains information consistent with ABA therapeutic interventions and that it offers valuable insights for serious game designers. Additionally, the GDD model provides characteristics that enable quantitative analysis of learning outcomes.},

  abstract={The goal of Genome-wide Association Studies GWAS is the identification of genetic variants, usually single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs, that are associated with disease risk. However, SNPs detected so far with GWAS for most common diseases only explain a small proportion of their total heritability. Gene set analysis GSA has been proposed as an alternative to single-SNP analysis with the aim of improving the power of genetic association studies. Nevertheless, most GSA methods rely on expensive computational procedures that make unfeasible their implementation in GWAS. We propose a new GSA method, referred as globalEVT, which uses the extreme value theory to derive gene-level p-values. GlobalEVT reduces dramatically the computational requirements compared to other GSA approaches. In addition, this new approach improves the power by allowing different inheritance models for each genetic variant as illustrated in the simulation study performed and allows the existence of correlation between the SNPs. Real data analysis of an Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ADHD study illustrates the importance of using GSA approaches for exploring new susceptibility genes. Specifically, the globalEVT method is able to detect genes related to Cyclophilin A like domain proteins which is known to play an important role in the mechanisms of ADHD development.},

This study proposes a novel virtual reality (VR) training system that simultaneously improves visual attention and pulmonary function in children with ADHD using fast Pranayama breathing, which is similar to the breathing method used to measure pulmonary function. We conducted the experiment with 12 children with ADHD who have normal pulmonary function in the control group and the experimental group, using the developed visual attention and pulmonary VR training system for eight training sessions in four weeks. The proposed system for children with ADHD consists of hardware that measures breathing and three VR games that use breathing data as direct input. The experiment result was analyzed by the Paired t-test for the pre-post comparisons and the Unpaired t-test for intergroup comparisons. Based on the conducted experiments and observations, we confirmed that the developed system can simultaneously improve visual attention and breathing capacity in children with ADHD.},

  abstract={Students’ motivation in computer graphic courses is a challenge for educators. Computer courses entail abstract notions and algorithmic features, and these difficulties affect the students’ motivation. A problem-based learning serious game framework named Immersivio was designed. The researchers designed a quantitative study with a between subject design and implemented a treatment course using the problem-based serious game. The game was designed based on the principles of problem-based learning and serious games, i.e., higher order thinking, collaborative learning, and cognitive thinking and information visualization theory. A non-random sampling procedure (purposive sampling) was used in this quasi-experimental study and the participants formed to 2 groups, the experimental group (n = 24) and the control group (n = 26). MANOVA test results indicated that the experimental group participants who had experienced the Immersivio game were more motivated to learn computer graphics in terms of extrinsic motivation, intrinsic motivation, interest, attainment, cost, identification with academics, self-efficacy, and instrumentality. This study has implications for basic and advanced computer graphic lecturers and educators in this field.},

  year={2022},
  volume={15},

  abstract={Several studies have been conducted in recent years into the effects of gamification on learner motivation. However, little is known about how learner profiles affect the impact of specific game elements. This article analyzes the effect of a gamified mathematic learning environment on the motivation and the motivated behaviors of 258 learners in secondary schools in France. Overall, results indicate that randomly assigned game elements generally demotivate learners. A more thorough analysis revealed that gamification has a positive impact on the most amotivated learners to do mathematic although different effects were observed on learners. In particular, we noticed significant influences of their initial level of motivation and their player type on the variation in motivation during the study. We show that these influences vary according to the game element they used. These findings suggest that to increase efficiency, gamification should be tailored not only to the player profile but also to their level of initial motivation for the learning task.},

  abstract={Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and basic computer games have been interconnected since BCI development began, exploiting gameplay elements as a means of enhancing performance in BCI training protocols and entertaining and challenging participants while training to use a BCI. By providing the BCI user with an entertaining environment, researchers hope to assist users in becoming more proficient at controlling a BCI system. BCIs have been used to enrich the experience of abled-bodied and physically impaired users in various computer applications, in particular, computer games. BCI games have been reviewed previously, yet a critical evaluation of “gameplay” within BCI games has not been undertaken. Gameplay is a key aspect of any computer game and encompasses the challenges presented to the player, the actions made available to the player by the game designer to overcome the challenges and the interaction mechanism in the game. Here, the appropriateness of game genres (a category of games characterized by a particular set of gameplay challenges) and the associated gameplay challenges for different BCI paradigms is evaluated. The gameplay mechanics employed across a range of BCI games are reviewed and evaluated in terms of the BCI control strategy's suitability, considering the genre and gameplay mechanics employed. A number of recommendations for the field relating to genre-specific BCI-games development and assessing user performance are also provided for BCI game developers.},

  abstract={Augmented Reality serious games have become an emerging solution to positively influence the learning experience for children born in the digital age. However, systematic and empirically tested design guidelines for AR serious games remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the design guidelines by designing and developing four AR serious games with different mechanics inspired by the psychological needs within Self-determination Theory, following with four user studies respectively. In the first study, we explored the AR game concepts by conducting participatory design sessions. In the second study, we investigated how children react to different types of interactions and feedback mechanics in AR serious games with 32 participants. Then, we scrutinized the effect of social interactions in AR serious games on children with 24 participants. Lastly, we designed an AR game with four different versions, tested pathways to immerse children to explore and play in an AR fantasy world with 81 participants. Generally, this research explored the concepts, prototypes, and results of incorporating AR with serious games for children. We realized multiple AR prototypes inspired by SDT and generalized a set of design guidelines, which are intended to help future related designs in AR serious games.},

  abstract={The majority of people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) exhibit difficulties in social communication and behavior, which hinder their learning capability, amid others. Among technological solutions for people with ASD, serious games are frequently used to enhance learning of specific skills and instructional contents. However, because of heterogeneity in applications and game design, few studies have investigated their use in training daily activities. This paper presents a 3D personalized serious game we developed and validated to help ASD patients practice with shopping activities. Personalized training is paramount in people with ASD, thus several elements of this game were personalized to improve engagement and therefore the effectiveness of the virtual training. In order to assess the validity of the game, ten subjects (age $\text{11.9} \pm \text{2.7}$, 20% female) with ASD played ten sessions of the serious game, once per week. The participants underwent a real-life experience pre- and post-training in a real-life supermarket. Changes in daily living skills among participants were evaluated through specific tools: a form based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health for Children and Youth; and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale II. Significant improvements (p$< $0.05) were detected in the main skills trained with the serious game, especially in learning the shopping procedure, directing attention, and problem-solving skills. These findings suggest that personalized serious games can represent a prominent tool to enhance daily living skills, but future work should clinically validate their efficacy.},

  abstract={In this paper we describe a case study in which we examine how to develop playful persuasive solutions to motivate older adults to maintain or increase their social and physical activities. By including various stakeholders (older adults, family, and care givers) and by designing for transitions in life we intend to create solutions that can be used by many different user groups. Based on a playful interaction framework and user studies we are designing playful persuasive solutions that incorporate social and physical activities as mutual motivators. Furthermore, the persuasive solutions should be relevant for the life transitions of losing partners or friends, of having to move to a care facility and of declining physical and cognitive capabilities. We describe our experiences with involving older adults in a design process. Finally, we present our initial concept the ‘Activator’, that provides awareness about upcoming activities and own performances and goals, and provides opportunities for older adults based on physical or social motivators to keep and extend their social circle, and to perform activities of lower and higher physical demand.},

  year={2012},
  volume={21},
  number={1},
  pages={1-15},
  abstract={This paper presents a novel multimodal virtual rehabilitation environment. Its design and implementation are based on principles related to intrinsic motivation and game design. The system consists of visual, acoustic, and haptic modalities. Elements contributing to intrinsic motivation are carefully joined in the three modalities to increase patients' motivation during the long process of rehabilitation. The message in a bottle (MIB) virtual scenario is designed to allow interplay between motor and cognitive challenges in the exercising patient. The user first needs to perform a motor action to receive a cognitive challenge that is finally solved by a second motor action. Visual feedback provides the most relevant information related to the task. Acoustic feedback consists of environmental sounds, music, and spoken instructions or encouraging statements for the patient. The haptic modality generates tactile information related to the environment and provides various modes of assistance for the patient's arm movements. The MIB scenario was evaluated with 16 stroke patients, who rated it positively using the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory questionnaire. Additionally, the MIB scenario seems to elicit higher motivation than a simpler pick-and-place training task.},

  pages={123588-123602},
  abstract={Learning to program at an early age has been shown to be a vehicle for the development of Computational Thinking. Game-based environments are often used to develop these skills, but they lack sufficient voluntariness to assess aspects related to intrinsic motivation, such as interests, skills, persistence in solving a problem and behavior in response to rewards. These aspects directly affect achievement and academic performance, so it is necessary to analyze possible age and gender differences in order to adjust Computational Thinking curricula. With this aim, we deployed a voluntary video game which addresses basic computational concepts, based on intrinsic motivation, and aimed at early ages. Data were collected and analyzed using game learning analytics for 15 months, during which 4124 users played more than 28187 games. The analysis shows significant age and gender differences in relation to interests, skills, achievement, and progression through attempts. It was observed that the concepts addressed were achievable between the ages of 3 and 6 years and full mastery was possible by the age of 4 years, regardless of gender, as children persist with the challenge, intrinsically motivated, until it is overcome. In terms of persistence, significantly different behaviors were observed in the face of the challenge, which can help us to adjust the different learning methodologies to each age group and gender, adapting the way we provide reinforcement and rewards, especially for boys in the more complex challenges and for girls from the age of 5 years onwards.},

In clinical AI, developing and utilizing robust and interpretable models has been a longstanding challenge. This survey investigates the current psychiatric practice of LLMs, along with a series of corpus resources that could be used for training psychiatric LLMs. We discuss the limitations concerning LLM reproducibility, capabilities, usability, interpretability in clinical settings, and ethical considerations. Additionally, we propose potential future directions for research, clinical application, and education in psychiatric LLMs. Finally, we discuss the challenge of integrating LLMs into the evolving landscape of healthcare in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract={In virtual prosthetic training research, serious games have been investigated for over 30 years. However, few game design elements are used and assessed for their effect on the voluntary adherence and repetition of the performed task. We compared two game-based versions of an established myoelectric-controlled virtual prosthetic training task with an interface without game elements of the same task [for video, see (Garske, 2022)]. Twelve limb-intact participants were sorted into three groups of comparable ability and asked to perform the task as long as they were motivated. Following the task, they completed a questionnaire regarding their motivation and engagement in the task. The investigation established that participants in the game-based groups performed the task significantly longer when more game design elements were implemented in the task (medians of 6 vs. 9.5 vs. 14 blocks for groups with increasing number of different game design elements). The participants in the game-based versions were also more likely to end the task out of fatigue than for reasons of boredom or frustration, which was verified by a fatigue analysis of the myoelectric signal. We demonstrated that the utilization of game design methodically in virtual myoelectric training tasks can support adherence and duration of a virtual training, in the short-term. Whether such short-term enhanced engagement would lead to long-term adherence remains an open question.},

  abstract={The high prevalence of mental disorders gradually poses a huge pressure on the public healthcare services. Deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has emerged to relieve the tension in healthcare institutions by detecting abnormal neuroimaging-derived phenotypes. However, training deep learning models relies on sufficient annotated datasets, which can be costly and laborious. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) and transfer learning (TL) can mitigate this challenge by leveraging unlabeled data within the same institution and advantageous information from source domain, respectively. This work is the first attempt to propose an effective semi-supervised transfer learning (SSTL) framework dubbed S3TL for CAD of mental disorders on fMRI data. Within S3TL, a secure cross-domain feature alignment method is developed to generate target-related source model in SSL. Subsequently, we propose an enhanced dual-stage pseudo-labeling approach to assign pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples in target domain. Finally, an advantageous knowledge transfer method is conducted to improve the generalization capability of the target model. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that S3TL achieves competitive accuracies of 69.14%, 69.65%, and 72.62% on ABIDE-I, ABIDE-II, and ADHD-200 datasets, respectively. Furthermore, the simulation experiments also demonstrate the application potential of S3TL through model interpretation analysis and federated learning extension.},

  abstract={Popular comments suggest that continuous exposure of children and adolescents to video games yields a non-benefit behavior in the players’ mental health. Contrarily, several studies have proven that commercial and serious games improve mental activity; some are used in treating psychological and physical disorders. This paper presents a method based on electroencephalogram signals analysis to classify multiple emotions recorded from subjects’ gameplay seasons. In the core of this study, a self-assessed labeling method is evaluated using the Force, EEG, and Emotion Labelled Dataset (FEEL) for emotion recognition tasks. Besides, a 1-D Local Binary Pattern (LBP) method transforms the EEG temporal behavior to extract time-frequency features. Complementarily, the database artifacts were removed using a novel Conflict Learning approach for machine learning models, associating the extracted samples with the subjects’ emotion labeling. A semi-supervised clustering method was employed to show the similarity between self-assessed subjects’ labels. Finally, numerical results suggested a conflict between 23 original labels, improving the classification by over 92% in accuracy for 19 self-assessed classes.},

  abstract={Effective educational interventions require sufficient learner engagement, which can be difficult to achieve if the learner is inadequately motivated. Games have been shown to possess powerful motivators that fuel a person's desire to engage in unattractive activities, such as learning theoretical material. However, to design an educational game that is capable of providing motivated engagement is a challenging task. Previous research has proposed various game motivators and game design principles to alleviate this, but a comprehensive synthesis has yet to appear. In this article, we conducted a systematic literature review that yielded two major contributions: 1) a taxonomy of 56 game motivators in 14 classes; and 2) a taxonomy of 54 educational game design principles in 13 classes, with linkages to the identified game motivators. As a minor contribution, we have also presented a classification of gamification-related terms and proposed different strategies for applying gamification. The results of this article are available for educational game designers and researchers to use as a practical toolkit for the creation and evaluation of motivating educational games that keep players engaged. Moreover, this article is the first step toward the creation of a unified gamification framework.},

  volume={1},
  number={1},
  pages={71-82},
  abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to study the participation behaviors in the context of crowdsourcing projects from the perspective of gamification. Design/methodology/approach – This paper first proposed a model to depict the effect of four categories of game elements on three types of motivation based upon several motivation theories, which may, in turn, influence user participation. Then, $5\times 2$ between-subject Web experiments were designed for collecting data and validating this model. Findings – Game elements which provide participants with rewards and recognitions or remind participants of the completion progress of their tasks may positively influence the extrinsic motivation, whereas game elements which can help create a fantasy scene may strengthen intrinsic motivation. Besides, recognition-kind and progress-kind game elements may trigger the internalization of extrinsic motivation. In addition, when a task is of high complexity, the effects from game elements on extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation will be less prominent, whereas the internalization of extrinsic motivation may benefit from the increase of task complexity. Originality/value – This study may uncover the motivation mechanism of several different kinds of game elements, which may help to find which game elements are more effective in enhancing engagement and participation in crowdsourcing projects. Besides, as task complexity is used as a moderator, one may be able to identify whether task complexity is able to influence the effects from game elements on motivations. Last, but not the least, this study will indicate the interrelationship between game elements, individual motivation and user participation, which can be adapted by other scholars.},

Our approach is based on framing games as educational tools that incorporate fun and learning through motivation as the key ingredient in the learning process and multimodal interaction as the medium for conveying educational material. The proposed solution formalizes the design process, describing educational games in terms of estimated effects that they produce on players. Building upon research on learning and motivation theory, we are connecting these effects with player learning preferences and motivation states. The essence of our solution is the educational game metamodel (EGM), which defines platform-independent educational game concepts. Using the EGM, we have explored novel design approaches for educational games. The metamodel can be used as a conceptual basis for creation of platform-independent educational games, allowing authoring for device and network independence.},

  abstract={Computer Science (CS) is a profession that positively impacts every single area of society without which today's world would come to a complete halt. Yet, there is a consensus that CS has serious conundrums particularly in attracting students, low motivation for learning computer programming and developing computational thinking (CT) skills. New motivational methods are needed to take the attention of students and adapt to their learning patterns as how people learn have changed drastically over the last two decades. To address these issues, video games and video game-based tools are proposed as a primary approach for motivating and supporting students in developing their skills in CT and support their learning of introductory programming. This research is concerned with the capture of statistical evidence on the educational effectiveness of playing a serious game specifically designed to enhance the development of CT skills to facilitate learning introductory computer programming. A total of 190 students were invited to participate in a quasi-experimental pre-post study for the purpose of analyzing the impact of an adhoc game on students' confidence in learning programming constructs and using their skills in CT. All students were studying a CS degree at the time and they were all registered to a first-year computer programming course. 151 out of 190 students successfully completed the study and the findings suggest that a) the intrinsic motivation to learn programming; b) students' perception of their knowledge and their tangible knowledge in key programming constructs (i.e. programming sequence, methods, decision making and loops); and c) students' confidence in using their CT skills were all statistically and significantly improved after playing the game. Additionally, students perceived computer programming significantly less difficult in their post study responses when compared to their pre study responses.},

  abstract={Exergames and serious games, based on standard personal computers, mobile devices and gaming consoles or on novel immersive Virtual and Augmented Reality techniques, have become popular in the last few years and are now applied in various research fields, among which cognitive assessment and training of heterogeneous target populations. Moreover, the adoption of Web based solutions together with the integration of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms could bring countless advantages, both for the patients and the clinical personnel, as allowing the early detection of some pathological conditions, improving the efficacy and adherence to rehabilitation processes, through the personalisation of training sessions, and optimizing the allocation of resources by the healthcare system. The current work proposes a systematic survey of existing solutions in the field of cognitive assessment and training. We evaluate the visualization and interaction technologies commonly adopted and the measures taken to fulfil the need of the pathological target populations. Moreover, we analyze how implemented solutions are validated, i.e. the chosen experimental designs, data collection and analysis. Finally, we consider the availability of the applications and raw data to the large community of researchers and medical professionals and the actual application of proposed solutions in the standard clinical practice. Despite the potential of these technologies, research is still at an early stage. Although the recent release of accessible immersive virtual reality headsets and the increasing interest on vision-based techniques for tracking body and hands movements, many studies still rely on non-immersive virtual reality (67.2%), mainly mobile and personal computers, and standard gaming tools for interactions (41.5%). Finally, we highlight that although the interest of research community in this field is increasingly higher, the sharing of dataset (10.6%) and implemented applications (3.8%) should be promoted and the number of healthcare structures which have successfully introduced the new technological approaches in the treatment of their host patients is limited (10.2%).},

  abstract={Pervasive computing technologies can help parents and occupational therapists modify behaviors in children. In occupational therapy, an effective means to motivate a change in a child's behavior is by designing playful activities that leverage the child's desire to play. By embedding digital technology into playful activity, pervasive computing technologies can make play-based occupational therapy more effective. This study proposes play-based activities targeted at eating and tooth-brushing behaviors in children.},

  title={Gameplay as a Source of Intrinsic Motivation for Individuals in Need of Ankle Training or Rehabilitation}, 
  year={2012},
  volume={21},
  number={1},
  pages={69-84},
  abstract={Injuries to the ankle may be a source of great discomfort and the long-term effects can negatively influence the future health of the individual who has suffered the injury. Wobble boards represent a relatively inexpensive type of equipment that may be used to train one's ankles preventively or as part of the rehabilitation process once the damage has been done. However, individuals in need of such training frequently lack the motivation necessary in order to successfully complete the training or rehabilitation process. This paper details the design and implementation of a prototype intended to alleviate this problem by leveraging games' potential as a source of intrinsic motivation. More specifically, the prototype enables users to control a game by means of a wobble board, thus allowing them to perform the necessary exercises while playing. An expert on ankle rehabilitation assessed the efficacy of the training facilitated by the prototype, and 40 individuals partook in a quantitative test performed in order to determine whether the prototype could potentially provide the needed motivation. Based on the findings from the two tests, it is concluded that the prototype does ensure correct ankle training and the act of playing was experienced as intrinsically motivating by the majority of the test participants.},

  year={2015},
  volume={59},
  number={6},
  pages={6:1-6:14},
  abstract={Games are not a new concept in learning. Game-based learning, simulations, and serious games are known pedagogical methods used to build on the inherent playfulness of learners. Technological advances and the popularity of learning management systems are making it easier to implement gamification, analyze the resulting engagement and playfulness, and modify the implementation if needed. However, knowledge is often missing about how different combinations of game mechanics and dynamics create playfulness. We discuss the concept of gamification behavior patterns, which are sequences of actions performed by a user that can be attributed to the application of a gamification design pattern. A preliminary experiment was conducted in an academic course where perceived playfulness was analyzed with respect to three different sets of independent variables: personality, perceived enjoyment from game mechanics, and gamification behavior patterns. Results show that it is practical to measure gamification behavior patterns and that they have a significant predictive power. We propose the development of an open-source, cloud-based gamification behaviors database that will collect specific gamification engagement events from systems worldwide, along with metadata about each implementation. With such a database, Big Data, machine-learning, and recommender-system algorithms can be applied to increase knowledge regarding steering user behaviors through gamification.},

  year={2019},
  volume={38},
  number={12},
  pages={2883-2890},
  abstract={Quantifying causal (effective) interactions between different brain regions are very important in neuroscience research. Many conventional methods estimate effective connectivity based on linear models. However, using linear connectivity models may oversimplify the functions and dynamics of the brain. In this paper, we propose a causal relationship estimator called nonlinear Causal Relationship Estimation by Artificial Neural Network (nCREANN) that identifies both linear and nonlinear components of effective connectivity in the brain. Furthermore, it can distinguish between these two types of connectivity components by calculating the linear and nonlinear parts of the network input-output mapping. The nCREANN performance has been verified using synthesized data and then it has been applied on EEG data collected during rest in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typically developing (TD) children. The results show that overall linear connectivity in TD subjects is higher, while the nonlinear connectivity component is more dominant in ASDs. We suggest that our findings may represent different underlying neural activation dynamics in ASD and TD subjects. The results of nCREANN may provide new insight into the connectivity between the interactive brain regions.},

  title={Motivation Under Gamification: An Empirical Study of Developers’ Motivations and Contributions in Stack Overflow}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={48},
  number={12},
  pages={4947-4963},
  abstract={To encourage developers’ volunteer contributions, modern programming question and answer (Q&A) sites like Stack Overflow (SO) employ gamified incentive mechanisms such as reputation and badges. Understanding developers’ motivations in the presence of gamification and the relationship between their motivations and behavioral outcomes is crucial for community building and designing good incentive mechanisms. Grounded on self-determination theory, we conducted a survey with 938 developers who participate in SO to understand their participation motivations and incentive perceptions. By connecting the survey responses with the SO data, we quantitatively analyzed how the developers’ motivations and satisfaction of needs relate to their effort and contribution quality. Our main findings are as follows: (1) despite the presence of gamified incentive mechanisms, developers are mainly motivated by intrinsic motivation to participate in SO; (2) developers who have strong motivations to gain gamification rewards are associated with higher intrinsic and integrated motivations, while developers with more development experiences are less motivated by the gamified incentives; (3) both extrinsic motivations (in terms of career prospects) and intrinsic motivations (regarding self-improvement and helping others) can motivate developers to make high-quantity and high-quality contributions; and (4) high-level satisfaction of needs for competency and autonomy has a positive effect on developers making high-quantity and high-quality contributions and addressing difficult problems. Based on these findings, we discuss implications for developer motivation and gamification in the crowdsourcing context and for the mechanism design of gamified crowdsourced platforms.},

  title={Gauging Engagement in Video Games: Does Game Violence Relate to Player Behavior? Report on a Study}, 
  year={2013},
  volume={25},
  number={4},
  pages={284-286},
  abstract={A study designed to define and measure the construct of ‘engagement’ with video games is reported, using a verbal questionnaire named the game engagement questionnaire (GEQ). The engagement construct is derived from an elaborate model of cognitive processes. Scale construction employed classical scaling techniques and the educationally oriented Rasch analytic procedures, and the authors assert that these procedures demonstrate that game engagement is quantifiable by the GEQ score. These analyses meet conventional psychometric standards, but they fail to clearly demonstrate construct unidimensionality. The theory behind the construct is complex and its relevance is not clear. Furthermore, restriction of attention to the violent aspects of games requires revalidation of the GEQ using non-violent (or less violent) games. The study restricted its attention to games with violent content, and showed that greater measured engagement in play of such games does manifest itself in higher scores on an existing aggression questionnaire (AQ). They infer that this association may be an indicator of the risk that deep engagement in violent video games could lead to actual aggressive behaviors on the part of players. This review acknowledges that GEQ is potentially useful for measuring some aspect of game engagement, but views the inferential linkage of engagement with aggressive behaviors based on questionable evidence concerning how game experiences are linked cognitively with emotional responses and behavioral changes outside of the game environment.},

  abstract={This paper discusses the effects of introducing new distributed and active instruments on narrative activities in a school environment. We address the issue of how the Pogo instruments change children's activity when they invent stories. The results enable us to compare the way the activity is carried out, both in its conventional context and with the Pogo instruments, mainly along three main lines of investigation: the collective dimension, the use of space and the structure of the narrative. The results also show that using the instruments increase the collective or group dimension of the creative process, particularly the role diversification and participation of the children. These instruments support children's efforts to structure narratives and thereby produce richer stories.This research was carried out within the Pogo Project by a multidisciplinary team that included interactive design and user-centered approaches within the EC I3 programme on ‘Exploring New Learning Futures for Children’.},

  title={Statistical Analyses of Brain Surfaces Using Gaussian Random Fields on 2-D Manifolds}, 
  year={2007},
  volume={26},
  number={1},
  pages={46-57},
  abstract={ Interest in the morphometric analysis of the brain and its subregions has recently intensified because growth or degeneration of the brain in health or illness affects not only the volume but also the shape of cortical and subcortical brain regions, and new image processing techniques permit detection of small and highly localized perturbations in shape or localized volume, with remarkable precision. An appropriate statistical representation of the shape of a brain region is essential, however, for detecting, localizing, and interpreting variability in its surface contour and for identifying differences in volume of the underlying tissue that produce that variability across individuals and groups of individuals. Our statistical representation of the shape of a brain region is defined by a reference region for that region and by a Gaussian random field (GRF) that is defined across the entire surface of the region. We first select a reference region from a set of segmented brain images of healthy individuals. The GRF is then estimated as the signed Euclidean distances between points on the surface of the reference region and the corresponding points on the corresponding region in images of brains that have been coregistered to the reference. Correspondences between points on these surfaces are defined through deformations of each region of a brain into the coordinate space of the reference region using the principles of fluid dynamics. The warped, coregistered region of each subject is then unwarped into its native space, simultaneously bringing into that space the map of corresponding points that was established when the surfaces of the subject and reference regions were tightly coregistered. The proposed statistical description of the shape of surface contours makes no assumptions, other than smoothness, about the shape of the region or its GRF. The description also allows for the detection and localization of statistically significant differences in the shapes of the surfaces across groups of subjects at both a fine and coarse scale. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these statistical methods by applying them to study differences in shape of the amygdala and hippocampus in a large sample of normal subjects and in subjects with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). },

  pages={65882-65905},
  abstract={Gamification is a potential approach to foster motivation and engagement in different contexts which popularity in recent years has encouraged its application in a diversity of domains, including health, education, business, society, or tourism. However, although all their promising benefits and rapidly developing, the gamification community should face a variety of theoretical, empirical, and technological challenges. Focusing on technological challenges, we can observe a need that claims for suitable gamification software tools that offer system-independence and flexibility, support the gamification design, implementation, and monitoring activities, and experiment with more game elements than only points, badges, and leaderboards. For that reason, this paper deals with the identified technological challenges by introducing a gamification software tool to cover the main lacks found. An analysis of the advances in gamification domain and their recent literature was conducted to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the most popular gamification software tools in order to design and develop a flexible system-independent gamification software solution that goes beyond the implementation of the classic game elements. As a result, we created GoRace, a multi-context and narrative-based gamification suite that supports the entire gamification process, provides flexible and system-independent gamification solutions, and allows the creation of tailored and reusable gamification solutions that go beyond the classic game elements to immerse participants in a fun, engaging, and challenging narrative-based gamification experience.},

  abstract={In this study we provide a new viewpoint on the body of literature regarding rewards in serious and educational games. The study includes a quantitative bibliometric analysis of literature in this context from 1969 to 2020. The dataset from the Scopus abstract and citation database was analyzed with the Bibliometrix R library. The data set was manually cleaned to contain only the relevant articles and conference papers. The data was then categorized to match the common themes. From the remaining documents, the amount of annual numbers of publications is presented and the most contributing countries are shown. The most frequent terms from the abstracts and keywords set by the authors are presented, and a co-occurrence network is drawn from the same data. The results of this study reveal that the most occurring topics in this dataset are gamification, physical activity, health, game design, and game-based learning. New directions for research are provided as the most commonly used media appear to be video games and mobile devices in addition to the literature being mostly focused on theory and not practical application.},

  abstract={An effective, efficient, and ecological transport service needs a decision support system to inform the administrations, while intelligently assisting citizens' daily transportation choices. This work presents a full-fledged Gamification Platform to develop and run sustainable mobility campaigns promoting individual green mobility behaviors. We organize geolocalized and temporal information on users' tracked trips into a rich dataset that decision-makers can exploit to analyze citizens' daily transportation choices and balance the demand and the offer of the mobility ecosystem. Through the Gamification Platform, we define three different use case scenarios - i.e., mobility within the city, home-work mobility, and home-school mobility. We also evaluate the platform according to both gameful design guidelines and persuasive technology best practices. Our findings show how long-term retention and engagement can be achieved when the gameful system's design and maintenance are assisted by the Gamification Platform, merging both administrative requirements and users' needs towards an iteratively adaptive and personalized experience.},

  abstract={Serious games are seeing use in a variety of fields, from the military to corporate management, and are finally being employed in healthcare. One of the biggest, most challenging areas is modeling simulations for medical training, particularly for managing chronic illness and providing system-level population-based care. CancerSpace (Cancer: Simulating Practice and Collaborative Education) is an interactive, Web-based learning application in a game format. CancerSpace, developed by the National Cancer Institute and Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, aims to facilitate cancer screening and consequently increase cancer-screening rates in federally qualified health centers. Our goal is to promote strategies and research-tested interventions that physicians and other healthcare workers can implement to overcome barriers and make cancer screening more efficient and cost-effective. This article reports on the development efforts required to create an e-learning tool designed for practitioners in community health centers. It concludes that the computer graphics and animation community has an important role in helping healthcare researchers design higher-fidelity educational games and simulations for improving the delivery of chronic care to the millions requiring it.},

  year={2023},

  pages={74898-74913},
  abstract={The use of serious games for the treatment of people with autism is currently considered a promising approach due to its positive effects on promoting learning through playful and motivating experiences. In recent years, increased research has focused on serious games utilizing Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) technologies, such as large-scale projection-based systems and head-mounted displays. The high level of immersion provided by IVR has been found to benefit learning outcomes, as it reduces environmental distractions and helps individuals focus on learning tasks while also addressing social anxiety. Researchers have conducted significant work in this field over the past decade, yielding promising results. However, the development of these learning interventions comes with methodological challenges and issues, especially in how to conduct the development process and design IVR-based serious games for the learning of people with autism. Based on these premises, this systematic review thoroughly analyzes the literature on developing IVR-based serious games for individuals with autism, discussing inherent shortcomings and reflecting on them. Then, twenty IVR-based serious games for people with autism developed between 2009 and mid-2021 are selected and analyzed, focusing on the people engaged in the development process, the design methodology adopted, and the serious game design framework employed. From this analysis, a set of recommendations are proposed to support anyone interested in developing IVR-based serious games for people with autism. In addition, the gaps left unsolved in the autism literature are highlighted, upon which a research agenda is grounded.},

  abstract={Although several definitions of gamification can be found in the literature, they all have in common certain aspects: the application of strategies, models, dynamics, mechanics, and elements of the games in other contexts than games, and the objective of producing a playful experience that fosters motivation, involvement, and fun. In this paper, our approach gamifying the learning process of a subject is presented. Our experience throughout time in using games and gamification in learning have led us to propose, lately, a personalized, automated, and gamified learning system. As a result of this experience and after several years of continuous feedback from our students, we have learned several lessons on how to approach the task of gamification. These lessons are summarized in the following concepts: fun, motivation, autonomy, progressiveness, feedback, error tolerance, experimentation, creativity, and adaptation to the specific case. The final aim is sharing our experience and opening a debate about what key elements the gamification lie in.},

  pages={3996-4024},
  abstract={Since the launch of the first consumer grade EEG measuring sensors `NeuroSky Mindset' in 2007, the market has witnessed an introduction of at least one new product every year by competing manufacturers, which include NeuroSky, Emotiv, interaXon and OpenBCI. There are numerous variations in the make and versions, but these products clearly share the key selling points of affordability, portability, and ease of use. These features are patently well placed provided one of the main objectives for their development is to attract a new target group of commercial users. Nevertheless, with several decades of traditional EEG usage in clinical and experimental settings, the shift toward commercial and engineering sides has not been achieved without skepticism. With this in mind, researchers in related fields have been tirelessly working to ensure that these putatively novel features were not introduced at the expense of efficiency and accuracy by conducting validation studies to compare the performance of data derived from consumer grade EEG devices with ones from standard research grade counterparts. In this review, we seek to provide the detail of the products supplied by the major players, summarize studies that evaluate consumer product's performance against research grade devices, the key areas of applications that these consumer grade devices have been employed in over the past five years or so, and finally give our perspectives on the limitations and what these innovative tools could offer going forward in terms of research and commercial applications.},

  year={2022},
  volume={38},
  number={6},
  pages={3582-3601},
  abstract={Applications of large-scale mobile multirobot systems can be beneficial over monolithic robots because of higher potential for robustness and scalability. Developing controllers for multirobot systems is challenging because the multitude of interactions is hard to anticipate and difficult to model. Automatic design using machine learning or evolutionary robotics seem to be options to avoid that challenge, but bring the challenge of designing reward or fitness functions. Generic reward and fitness functions seem unlikely to exist and task-specific rewards often have undesired side effects. Approaches of so-called innate motivation try to avoid the specific formulation of rewards and work instead with different drivers, such as curiosity. Our approach to innate motivation is to minimize surprise, which we implement by maximizing the accuracy of the swarm robot’s sensor predictions using neuroevolution. A unique advantage of the swarm robot case is that swarm members populate the robot’s environment and can trigger more active behaviors in a self-referential loop. In this article, we summarize our previous simulation-based results concerning behavioral diversity, robustness, scalability, and engineered self-organization, and put them into context. In several new studies, we analyze the influence of the optimizer’s hyperparameters, the scalability of evolved behaviors, and the impact of realistic robot simulations. Finally, we present results using real robots that show how the reality gap can be bridged.},

We conduct a user study that examines visual biofeedback and game adaptation as independent variables with electrodermal activity, heart rate variability, and respiration as dependent variables. In particular, we evaluate these forms of biofeedback by their ability to facilitate acquisition of relaxation skills and promote skill transfer to subsequent stressful tasks. Our results indicate that game adaptation promotes skill acquisition and transfer more effectively than visual biofeedback, but that a combination of the two outperforms either in isolation. Combining visual and game biofeedback also results in faster learning of deep-breathing skills than either channel alone. Our study suggests that the two forms of biofeedback play different roles, with game adaptation being more effective in encouraging deep breathing, and visual channels helping players maintain the target breathing rate.},

  pages={28564-28578},
  abstract={Extremist ideologies are proliferating nowadays in both political and social levels. Considering that youngsters are in a development stage where they are still conforming their own social identity, they become especially vulnerable to these ideologies’ influence. Therefore, it becomes critical to provide them with the psychological skills to rationalize and resist those influences. Video games, which are already a technology commonly consumed by these generations, provide a way to motivate and engage youngsters. Therefore, implementing these video games in interventions to increase psychological resilience represents an opportunity to create an innovative learning approach. Following this motivation, this paper has three main objectives: adapting a traditional emotional intelligence training program to a novel serious game based intervention, called YoungRes; providing a metric to measure the student’ evolution based on in-game behavioural patterns, instead of indirect measures; and evaluating the impact of the intervention itself after its implementation. To do so, an 11 sessions intervention was applied to 36 students from two primary schools in Spain. Quantitative and qualitative data was extracted from the experience, consisting on data extracted from the player’s behaviour and a final survey. A detailed statistical analysis carried out showed two main outcomes: first, the serious game based intervention was very appreciated by the students, specially by those who frequently play video games; second, the intervention allowed to improve several emotional intelligence competences, such as active listening and controlled breathing, as well as to promote knowledge about the Islamic culture. Finally, the authors discussed about how the game could be improved for future applications in schools.},

  abstract={Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be computationally more powerful than conventional NNs. However, the capability of SNNs in solving complex real-world problems remains to be demonstrated. In this paper, we propose a substantial extension of the Bienenstock, Cooper, and Munro (BCM) SNN model, in which the plasticity parameters are regulated by a gene regulatory network (GRN). Meanwhile, the dynamics of the GRN is dependent on the activation levels of the BCM neurons. We term the whole model “GRN-BCM.” To demonstrate its computational power, we first compare the GRN-BCM with a standard BCM, a hidden Markov model, and a reservoir computing model on a complex time series classification problem. Simulation results indicate that the GRN-BCM significantly outperforms the compared models. The GRN-BCM is then applied to two widely used datasets for human behavior recognition. Comparative results on the two datasets suggest that the GRN-BCM is very promising for human behavior recognition, although the current experiments are still limited to the scenarios in which only one object is moving in the considered video sequences.},

  year={2011},
  volume={58},
  number={4},
  pages={1084-1093},
  abstract={The brain shows complex, nonstationarity temporal dynamics, with abrupt micro- and macrostate transitions during its information processing. Detecting and characterizing these transitions in dynamical states of the brain is a critical issue in the field of neuroscience and psychiatry. In the current study, a novel method is proposed to quantify brain macrostates (e.g., sleep stages or cognitive states) from shifts of dynamical microstates or dynamical nonstationarity. A "dynamical microstate" is a temporal unit of the information processing in the brain with fixed dynamical parameters and specific spatial distribution. In this proposed approach, a phase-space-based dynamical dissimilarity map (DDM) is used to detect transitions between dynamically stationary microstates in the time series, and Tsallis time-dependent entropy is applied to quantify dynamical patterns of transitions in the DDM. We demonstrate that the DDM successfully detects transitions between microstates of different temporal dynamics in the simulated physiological time series against high levels of noise. Based on the assumption of nonlinear, deterministic brain dynamics, we also demonstrate that dynamical nonstationarity analysis is useful to quantify brain macrostates (sleep stages I, II, III, IV, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep) from sleep EEGs with an overall accuracy of 77%. We suggest that dynamical nonstationarity is a useful tool to quantify macroscopic mental states (statistical integration) of the brain using dynamical transitions at the microscopic scale in physiological data.},

  abstract={Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in serious games (SGs), i.e., digital games for education and training. However, although the potential scalability of SGs to large player populations is often praised in the literature, available SG evaluations did not provide evidence of it because they did not study learning on large, varied, international samples in naturalistic conditions. This article considers a SG that educates players about aircraft cabin safety. It presents the first study of learning in a SG intervention conducted in naturalistic conditions with a very large, worldwide sample, which includes 45,000 players who accepted to answer a knowledge questionnaire before and after playing the game, and more than 400,000 players whose in-game behavior was analyzed. Results show that the SG led to improvement in players’ knowledge, assessed with different metrics. Moreover, analysis of repeated play shows that participants improved their in-game safety behavior over time. We also focus on the role of making errors in the game, showing how they led to improvement in knowledge. Finally, we highlight the theoretical models, such as error-based learning and Protection Motivation Theory, that oriented the game design, and can be reused to create SGs for other domains.},

  year={2015},
  volume={35},

  pages={65-73},
  abstract={People all use more or less adapted strategies to confront adverse emotional situations in their lives without being psychologically affected. The emotional regulation (ER) strategies that we use determine the way in which we feel, express, and behave. Moreover, ER strategies are particularly important in adolescents, a population for which ER strategy deficits can be linked to the appearance of numerous mental health disorders, such as depression or anxiety, or disruptive behaviors. Thus, the early detection of dysfunctional ER strategies and training in adaptive ER strategies can help prevent future occurrences of possible behavioral and psychosocial disorders. In this article, the authors present the GameTeen System (GT-System), a novel instrument based on virtual reality and serious games for the assessment and training of ER strategies in adolescents. The results of their preliminary evaluation suggest that this system can effectively train and evaluate emotional regulation strategies in adolescents.},

  year={2021},

  pages={619-628},
  abstract={Sensory abnormalities are experienced by 90 - 95% of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a developmental disorder that impacts at least 1 in 132 children worldwide. Virtual reality (VR) technologies can precisely present sensory stimuli and be integrated with human sensing technologies to automatically detect sensory responses, and thus has a potential to improve sensory assessment objectiveness and sensitivity, compared to traditional questionnaire-based methods. However, there is a lack of evidence to demonstrate this potential. Therefore, we designed and developed a preliminary sensory assessment VR system (SAVR) to objectively and precisely evaluate the visual and touch sensory processing differences between adolescents with ASD and their typically developing (TD) peers through game playing. A controlled experiment was conducted with 12 adolescents with ASD and 12 TD adolescents. Participants' sensory pattern was assessed by SAVR and a widely used traditional questionnaire-the Adult/Adolescent Sensory Profile (AASP). We hypothesized that: 1) compared to AASP, SAVR can find more significant differences between the two participant groups, and 2) there are significant and strong correlations between the SAVR results and the AASP results. Statistical analyses of the experimental data supported the hypotheses. The implication and limitations of this preliminary exploration as well as future works are discussed.},

  abstract={The deficit in social interaction skills among individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is strongly influenced by personal experiences and social environments. Neuroimaging studies have previously highlighted the link between social impairment and brain activity in ASD. This study aims to develop a method for assessing and identifying ASD using a social cognitive game-based paradigm combined with electroencephalo-graphy (EEG) signaling features. Typically developing (TD) participants and autistic preadolescents and teenagers were recruited to participate in a social game while 12-channel EEG signals were recorded. The EEG signals underwent preprocessing to analyze local brain activities, including event-related potentials (ERPs) and time-frequency features. Additionally, the global brain network’s functional connectivity between brain regions was evaluated using phase-lag indices (PLIs). Subsequently, machine learning models were employed to assess the neurophysiological features. Results indicated pronounced ERP components, particularly the late positive potential (LPP), in parietal regions during social training. Autistic preadolescents and teenagers exhibited lower LPP amplitudes and larger P200 amplitudes compared to TD participants. Reduced theta synchronization was also observed in the ASD group. Aberrant functional connectivity within certain time intervals was noted in the ASD group. Machine learning analysis revealed that support-vector machines achieved a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 91.7%, and accuracy of 95.8% as part of the performance evaluation when utilizing ERP and brain oscillation features for ASD characterization. These findings suggest that social interaction difficulties in autism are linked to specific brain activation patterns. Traditional behavioral assessments face challenges of subjectivity and accuracy, indicating the potential use of social training interfaces and EEG features for cognitive assessment in ASD.},

  volume={29},

  pages={455-466},
  abstract={Abstract We experience virtual worlds as avatars—we dress, move, engage in activities or interact with other users as avatars. Recent studies suggest that embodying an avatar does not only influence users’ behavior in a virtual environment, but it can also change users’ behavior in reality. However, little has been known about the role of an avatar's appearance in changing users’ behavior through embodying the avatar. We investigated how an online game avatar's body shape (obese vs. normal weight) and health behavior (healthy behavior vs. unhealthy behavior) can affect users’ health behavior after their virtual experience. Specifically, we conducted a laboratory experiment, and assigned participants to either an obese or a normal-weight avatar in a game. Half of the participants’ avatars performed healthy behaviors (engaged in physical activities and vegetable consumption), and the other half of participants performed unhealthy behaviors (engaged in sedentary behavior and binge-eating). After 20-min gameplay, participants were offered a box with high-sugar cookies, and also asked to use an exercising machine. According to the results, the normal avatar's healthy behavior increased participants’ exercising behavior (use of the exercising machine). However, the obese avatar's healthy behavior did not. Additional analyses revealed that using an avatar with an unhealthy lifestyle predicted male participants’ consumption of high-sugar cookies. The avatar's body shape alone did not independently predict neither participants’ exercising behavior nor cookie consumption. Theoretical and practical implications for the use of virtual environments to increase users’ health behavior were discussed.},

  title={Heroine’s Learning Journey: Motivating Women in STEM Online Courses Through the Power of a Narrative}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={12},
  number={},
  pages={20103-20124},
  abstract={Although Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) are essential for the development of society, men hugely outnumber women in the majority of STEM fields in higher education, a factor that hinders inclusion and restricts the possibility of having different points-of-view. Previous studies indicate multiple causes of low female motivation in STEM degrees and careers, which inspired several initiatives to increase female interest in STEM. A proven way to captivate an audience to change its attitude is the heroic narrative model, a style of narrative in which a character goes through a sequence of difficulty-increasing and attitude-shaping quests. This paper proposes a heroic narrative model named Heroine’s Learning Journey (HLJ) targeted at counteracting low female participation in STEM courses. In particular, the HLJ model is developed especially for enhancing STEM online courses, by using a narrative that can encourage female students to engage and prevail in them. The HLJ model is divided into three acts, each composed of several stages symbolizing steps tailored to a female student’s development. The model was applied to set up the structure of a preexisting Machine Learning online course with hundreds of enrolled students. Although a first version of the course already presented a higher-than-expected female enrollment per se ( $\approx 37.3\%$ ), with HLJ, we verified an even higher female enrollment ( $\approx 59.2\%$ ), slightly surpassing male enrollments. The feedback provided in learners’ responses to a final, voluntary and anonymous questionnaire, allowed to obtain the degree of satisfaction of participants at the end of the course with the HLJ. The responses indicated that, at the end of the second edition of the online course, students were able to acknowledge the existence of a STEM gender imbalance, and appreciated the motivating nature of the HLJ model. From several student’s feedback and comments submitted in the questionnaire, one can conclude that the attitude-shaping character of the HLJ was greatly appreciated, in addition to the technical content of the course. All these preliminary results are indicative of the usability of HLJ to foster gender balance in STEM online courses. Thus, the present study contributes to STEM Education by leveraging the motivation of young women to enter and prevail in these areas of study.},

  abstract={The design goals of recently developed serious games are to improve attention, affective recognition, and social interactions among individuals with autism. However, most previous studies on serious games used behavioral questionnaires to evaluate their effectiveness. The cognitive assessment of individuals with autism after behavioral intervention or drug treatment has become important because it provides promising biomarkers to assess improvement after cognitive intervention. In this study, we developed a game-based social interaction platform incorporating an eye-tracking system for children and preadolescents with autism. Three modules (focusing on gaze following, facial emotion recognition, and social interaction skills) are included in the platform; participants with autism learn these according to their cognitive abilities. The eye-tracking results showed decreased fixation durations when autistic children looked at positive emotional expressions and focused on multiple targets. Prolonged saccade durations and shorter fixation times for social-related facial emotion expressions were also found in preadolescents and teenagers with autism. Our findings suggest that these atypical gaze patterns are reliable biomarkers for evaluating the social and cognitive functions of autistic individuals while playing serious games. The proposed platform’s game-based modules and the findings regarding aberrant gaze patterns in autistic individuals demonstrate the possibility of evaluating cognitive functions and intervention effectiveness by using eye-tracking signals in a serious game or real-life environment.},

  abstract={Incorporating intrinsic motivation with reinforcement learning can permit agents to independently choose, which skills they will develop, or to change their focus of attention to learn different skills at different times. This implies an autonomous developmental process for skills in which a skill-acquisition goal is first identified, then a skill is learned to solve the goal. The learned skill may then be stored, reused, temporarily ignored or even permanently erased. This paper formalizes the developmental process for skills by proposing a goal-lifecycle using the option framework for motivated reinforcement learning agents. The paper shows how the goal-lifecycle can be used as a basis for designing motivational state-spaces that permit agents to reason introspectively and autonomously about when to learn skills to solve goals, when to activate skills, when to suspend activation of skills or when to delete skills. An algorithm is presented that simultaneously learns: 1) an introspective policy mapping motivational states to decisions that change the agent's motivational state, and 2) multiple option policies mapping sensed states and actions to achieve various domain-specific goals. Two variations of agents using this model are compared to motivated reinforcement learning agents without introspection for controlling non-player characters in a computer game scenario. Results show that agents using introspection can focus their attention on learning more complex skills than agents without introspection. In addition, they can learn these skills more effectively.},

  abstract={Serious video games provide a immersive learning environment for agriculture by simulating real-life challenges scenarios. However, empirical evidence of their effectiveness is sparse. This scoping review follows PRISMA-ScR guidelines to summarize literature on serious video games for agricultural learning, highlighting research trends and identifying gaps. We systematically searched nine prominent research databases for papers on serious video games for agriculture learning published between January 2000 and July 2022. Two independent reviewers conducted screening, data extraction, and synthesized the collected data using a narrative approach. The initial search identified 3,297 articles, of which 0.58% (n = 19) were included in the review. Most reviewed games were released in the last five years, with a predominant presence in the mobile platform. They commonly employed a simulation-based approach, featuring 2-D graphics and designed for single-player experiences. These games mainly target students, focusing on crop production and sustainable agriculture. Educational theories were often unspecified in the studies. Evaluation protocols primarily consisted of pilot studies, emphasizing user experience and knowledge enhancement. Positive outcomes, such as improved user experiences, knowledge, and attitude and behavior changes, were commonly observed in these studies. This study highlights advancements in using serious video games for agricultural learning over 20 years. However, it stresses the need for deeper exploration of game elements' impact on user experience and effectiveness. Creating games for underrepresented players and specific agricultural challenges is essential, as is enhancing theoretical foundations and learning approaches. Rigorous research designs are vital for assessing game effectiveness across short, medium, and long terms.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and user study evaluation of a socially assistive robot (SAR) system designed to engage elderly users in physical exercise aimed at achieving health benefits and improving quality of life. We discuss our design methodology, which incorporates insights from psychology research in the area of intrinsic motivation, and focuses on maintaining engagement through personalized social interaction. We describe two user studies conducted to test the motivation theory in practice with our system. The first study investigated the role of praise and relational discourse in the exercise system by comparing a relational robot coach to a nonrelational robot coach. The second study evaluated participant preferences regarding user choice in the task scenario. Both studies served to evaluate the feasibility and overall effectiveness of the robot exercise system. The results of both studies are presented; they show a strong user preference for the relational over the nonrelational robot in terms of enjoyableness, companionship, and as an exercise coach, varying user preferences regarding choice, and high user ratings of the system across multiple metrics. The outcomes of the presented user studies, brought together, support the motivational capabilities of the robot, and demonstrate the viability and usefulness of the system in motivating exercise in elderly users.},

  abstract={The aim of the research is to determine the impact of video games on the development of meaningful learning in the field of mathematics among students in Regular Basic Education. The research was carried out through a quasi-experimental process and a systematic review of sources. A structured design was used in a pretest and posttest with a one-month application interval, during which three educational video games were used: Strategy, Adventure, and Simulation. The population consisted of 40 students divided into four groups: Three experimental groups and one control group, each composed of ten students. The results showed a significant influence of video games on the development of meaningful learning in the field of mathematics; it was observed that video games function as an educational complement and not as an absolute pedagogical means. The lack of reliability is highlighted due to the inability to control the learning pace of each student, and the possible ethical impacts inherent in education are pointed out. The conclusions show that, although video games can contribute to the development of meaningful learning in the field of mathematics, their use should be considered as part of a comprehensive pedagogical approach and not as the sole teaching and learning tool.},

  abstract={Gamification has rapidly emerged as one of the favorite persuasive technologies widely used with the aim of promoting a positive change in the user's behavior by means of including game-like elements in non-game contexts. As a research discipline, gamification is growing fast, maturing from basic and fundamental questions such as what and why gamify to more mature ones such as how to gamify, when and when not, and still facing empirical and theoretical challenges to prove the effects of its practice and consolidate the principles that guide meaningful gamification designs. The purpose of this paper is to conduct a bibliometric study to describe how gamification as a scientific discipline is structured and how it has evolved over time. To do this, we make use of bibliometric performance analysis and science mapping methods to display and analyze the intellectual, conceptual and social network structures of gamification research, as well as the evolution and dynamical aspects of the discipline. The results reveal the research fronts and intellectual structures of the field, the internal relationships among articles, authors and keywords, the existing networks of collaboration, the emerging trends, the hot topics, and the most influential authors, publications and sources. Together, they picture the intellectual landscape of gamification as a scientific field that will be useful for junior and senior researchers, practitioners, funding agencies and policymakers.},

  pages={120659-120679},
  abstract={This paper examines intrinsic motivation-driven game elements and designs an Intrinsic Motivation Gamification Framework to provide undergraduates with a persistent, scaffolded, and satisfying online learning experience based on different user profiles. Gamification has become the primary resolution to the low retention rate in learning platforms for undergraduates. However, most gamified learning studies focus on the player-type profiling method, while no intrinsic motivation-driven game elements are mapped to certain players. This paper refined self-needs and user motivation in the learning experience from different user behaviours through the distinction method of Grasha Learner Style, deriving six types of learners: independent, dependent, participant, avoidance, collaborative, and competitive. Based on the literature review, a gamified framework has been developed to engage undergraduates to persist in using a self-developed gamified platform, GamiClass, for up to 16 weeks. A suggested 20 game elements have been deployed based on the needs of the Octalysis Framework and Self-Determination Theory. The analysis mirrored the positive impact of game elements (group quest, challenges, and time pressure) on the undergraduates. In contrast, choices/consequences and exploration game elements negatively affect the undergraduates’ continuity in the gamified platform. Furthermore, the group quest was identified as the critical game element that stimulates various types of undergraduates in competition and collaboration, thus internalising their extrinsic motivation into intrinsic motivation during their learning journey.},

  title={Gaming Away Stress: Using Biofeedback Games to Learn Paced Breathing}, 
  year={2020},
  volume={11},
  number={3},
  pages={519-531},
  abstract={Biofeedback games are an attractive alternative to standard techniques for learning short-term relaxation skills. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of three respiratory biofeedback games. To validate these games, we compared breathing rate across 100 male participants (23 years ± 3.2 years) playing biofeedback and audio pacing versions of these games as well as a paced breathing app. The games were placed between repeat runs of a cognitively stressful Stroop-based task and the impact of the games on breathing and cognitive performance in the task also assessed. Our results showed that 1) differences in gameplay did not impact player performance; 2) biofeedback not only led to better breath control during play but also during the subsequent cognitively stressful task; and 3) biofeedback led to better attentional-cognitive performance in the subsequent task. Our multi-game experiments show that using respiratory biofeedback in video games is an effective strategy to learn paced breathing—on par with the standalone technique of paced breathing—and to self-regulate stress levels in later stressful scenarios. Furthermore, owing to its entertainment value, our relaxation solution has the potential to be more engaging and accessible than standalone paced breathing, for use over longer durations.},

  title={User-Centred Design and Usability Evaluation of a Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback Game}, 
  year={2016},
  volume={4},

  pages={5531-5539},
  abstract={Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) is an indicator of a malfunctioning autonomic nervous system. Resonant frequency breathing is a potential non-invasive means of intervention for improving the balance of the autonomic nervous system and increasing HRV. However, such breathing exercises are regarded as boring and monotonous tasks. The use of gaming elements (gamification) or a full gaming experience is a well-recognised method for achieving higher motivation and engagement in various tasks. However, there is limited documented knowledge on how to design a game for breathing exercises. In particular, the influence of additional interactive elements on the main course of training has not yet been explored. In this paper, we evaluated the satisfaction levels achieved using different game elements and how disruptive they were to the main task, i.e., paced breathing training. An Android flight game was developed with three game modes that differ in the degrees of multitasking they require. Design, development, and evaluation were conducted using a user-centred approach, including context analysis, the design of game principle mock-ups, the selection of game principles through a survey, the design of the game mechanics and GUI mock-up, and icon testing, and the performance of a summative study through user questionnaires and interviews. A summative evaluation of the developed game was performed with 11 healthy participants (ages 40-67) in a controlled setting. The results confirm the potential of video games for motivating players to engage in HRV biofeedback training. The highest training performance on the first try was achieved through pure visualisation rather than in a multitasking mode. Players had higher motivation to play the more challenging game and were more interested in long-term engagement. A framework for gamified HRV biofeedback research is presented. It has been shown that multitasking has considerable influence on HRV biofeedback and should be used with an adaptive challenge level.},

  abstract={Reading acquisition is one the main keys for school success and a crucial component for empowering individuals to participate meaningfully in society. Yet, it is still a challenging skill to acquire for around 10% of children that have dyslexia, a type of neuro-developmental disorder that affects the ability to learn how to read and write. Dyslexia is often under-diagnosed, and normally children with dyslexia are only detected once they fail in school, even though dyslexia is not related to general intelligence. In this work, we present an approach for screening dyslexia using language-independent games in combination with machine learning models. To reach this goal, we designed the content of a computer game, collected data from 137 children playing this game (51 with dyslexia) in different languages -German, Spanish and English- and created a prediction model using different machine learning classifiers. Our method provides a precision of 0.78 and recall of 0.79 for German and a precision of 0.83 and recall of 0.80 for all languages when Extra Trees are used, with an accuracy of 0.67 and 0.75, respectively. Our results open the possibility of inexpensive online early screening of dyslexia for young children using non-linguistic elements.},

  abstract={Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that may lead to significant impairment in social communication, repetitive patterns of behavior, and possible fixed and restricted interests. Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a well-supported and evidence-based treatment for the delays attributed to ASD. Assistive technologies, such as gamification, software apps, computer-based training (Web), and robotics; provide a standardized method of implementing ABA techniques. This review provides a synthesis of the main characteristics of these technologies. The assessed proposals focused on technologies such as Distributed Systems, Image Processing, Gamification, and Robotics. The primary objectives of these tools sought to improve social behavior, attention, communication, and reading skills. Some common limitations found in the literature was a failure to accurately define their target audience, and a failure to comply with the dimensions of ABA as defined by Baer, Wolf, and Risley in 1968.},

  year={2021},
  volume={14},
  number={2},
  pages={297-302},
  abstract={The current practice of administering neurofeedback using the patients' visual and/or auditory channel(s) is known to cause fatigue, excessive boredom, and restricted mobility during prolonged therapy sessions. This paper proposes haptics as an alternative means to provide neurofeedback and investigates its effectiveness by conducting two user studies (Study- I & II) using a novel compact wearable haptic device that provides vibrotactile feedback to the user's neck. Each user study has three neurofeedback modes: visual-only, haptics-only, and visual-and-haptics combined. Study- I examines the participant's performance in a brain-training task by measuring their attention level (AL) and the task completion time (CT). Study- II, in addition to the brain-training task, investigates the participants' ability to perform a secondary task (playing a shape-sorting game) while receiving the neurofeedback. Results show that users performed similarly well in brain-training with haptics-only and visual-only feedback. However, when engaged in a secondary task, the users performed significantly better (AL and CT improved around 11% and 17%, respectively) with haptics, indicating a clear advantage of haptics over visual neurofeedback. Being able to perform routine activities during brain-training would likely increase user adherence to longer therapy sessions. In the future, we plan to verify these findings by conducting experiments on ADHD-patients.},

  pages={1710-1719},
  abstract={The human cerebellum contains almost 50% of the neurons in the brain, although its volume does not exceed 10% of the total brain volume. The goal of this study is to derive the functional network of the cerebellum during the resting-state and then compare the ensuing group networks between males and females. Toward this direction, a spatially constrained version of the classic spectral clustering algorithm is proposed and then compared against conventional spectral graph theory approaches, such as spectral clustering, and N-cut, on synthetic data as well as on resting-state fMRI data obtained from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). The extracted atlas was combined with the anatomical atlas of the cerebellum resulting in a functional atlas with 46 regions of interest. As a final step, a gender-based network analysis of the cerebellum was performed using the data-driven atlas along with the concept of the minimum spanning trees. The simulation analysis results confirm the dominance of the spatially constrained spectral clustering approach in discriminating activation patterns under noisy conditions. The network analysis results reveal statistically significant differences in the optimal tree organization between males and females. In addition, the dominance of the left VI lobule in both genders supports the results reported in a previous study of ours. To our knowledge, the extracted atlas comprises the first on HCP data.},

  abstract={Serious Games have emerged as a valuable tool to facilitate education in stress management, also the serious game being collaborative is a way to have a greater effectiveness for users in their learning, on the other hand, Mindfulness techniques are also an effective tool to manage stress, but each has been used individually. This article aims to develop a serious game that involves collaboration to support teaching processes of stress management through Mindfulness techniques in university students and its evaluation in potential users of its use. The method used for its design is the SAVIE methodology which is user-centered and applies to the context of university students focused on the creation of games with pedagogical and ludic objectives. The development was done with Adobe Illustrator for its digital design and as digital engine Unity doing the programming with C#, where finally the deployment is done in Android operating system and 3 people can play collaboratively. The results of this study were obtained by conducting a validation of this serious game “RAIDER” with 11 potential users, who participated in sessions, where they were conducted two interviews with each participant, one before and one after playing the game, to assess their ability to cope with stress, making use of the perceived stress scale and mindfulness scale and finally making a T-test that tells us that the results are significant in learning Mindfulness techniques to cope with stress in college students.},

Experimental results under the static tests show the effectiveness of the proposed model in simulating real BCBs. Furthermore, we verify the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed model through the dynamic experimental tests in a simulated vehicle. This paper not only promotes the understanding and prediction of BCBs, but also provides some insights into assistive technology on brain-controlled systems and extends the scope of research on human behavior modeling.},

  abstract={Virtual reality is highly recommended for stroke rehabilitation as it was found to aid in recovery and can motivate users. While there are various virtual reality rehabilitation studies, the impact of virtual environments on rehabilitation has been less studied. This study investigates the added value of an enriched virtual environment on motivation and engagement in stroke rehabilitation. We conducted a validity study on healthy participants (N=25) in two environments: enriched virtual reality and non-enriched virtual reality. Our hypotheses are: 1) An enriched virtual environment with multisensory feedback, gamification, and adaptive function adds value to user motivation and engagement by increasing interest/enjoyment, perceived choice, value/usefulness, and relatedness of the application. 2) Motivated and engaged users spend more time or score more points in the application. The key findings of this study are that intrinsic motivation is higher in the enriched virtual environment (EVE) compared to the non-enriched virtual environment (NEVE). There are significant differences in motivation between these two environments. Furthermore, results show that more participants are engaged in the enriched virtual environment, spending more time, and scoring higher (Spearman’s  $\rho =0.809$ ).},

  pages={108144-108161},
  abstract={The high dropout rate, lack of learners’ motivation, and MOOC users’ diversity are significant issues in MOOCs. In this sense, gamification is used to investigate if it can help to increase MOOC learners’ motivation and engagement, leading to a continued usage scenario. Further, this article aims to propose a theoretical model to identify the factors affecting MOOC learners’ continuance and empirically measure these factors. The model is based on the Expectation Confirmation Model (ECM) with additional constructs of motivation and gamification. Data is collected from 206 university students using an online survey. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is used for data analysis. The results show that motivation, satisfaction, and perceived usefulness influence continuous intention, with satisfaction being the most significant predictor ( $\beta =0.373$ , p < 0.000). Motivation, confirmation, and perceived usefulness have a significant positive effect on satisfaction. Among the three gamification categories, achievement has the highest impact on motivation ( $\beta =0.208$ , p < 0.001), followed by the social category ( $\beta =0.143$ , p < 0.032). The effect of the immersion category is found to be non-significant. Based on the results, appropriate theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

  abstract={We describe a graphical narrative editor that we have developed for the design of serious games for cognitive neurorehabilitation. The system is addressed to neuropsychologists. It is aimed at providing them an easy, user-friendly, and fast way of specifying the therapeutical contents of the rehabilitation tasks that constitute the serious games. The editor takes as input a description of the virtual task environment and the actions allowed inside. Therapists use it to describe the actions that they expect patients to do in order to fulfill the goals of the task and the behavior of the game if patients do not reach their goals. The output of the system is a complete description of the task logic. We have designed a 3D game platform that provides to the editor a description the 3D virtual environments, and that translates the task description created in the editor into the task logic. The main advantage of the system is that it is fully automatic, it allows therapists to interactively design the tasks and immediately validate them by realizing it virtually. We describe the design of the two applications and present the results of system testing.},

While these devices have initially been utilized in clinical and research settings, recent advancements in neurotechnology have yielded devices that are more portable, user friendly, and less expensive. These improvements allow laypeople to monitor their brain waves and interface their brains with external devices. Such improvements have led to the rise of wearable neurotechnology that is marketed to the consumer. While many of the consumer devices are marketed for innocuous applications, such as use in video games, there is potential for them to be repurposed for medical uses. How do we manage neurotechnologies that skirt the line between medical and consumer applications and what can be done to ensure consumer safety? Here, we characterize neurotechnology based on medical and consumer applications and summarize currently marketed uses of consumer-grade wearable headsets. We lay out concerns that may arise due to the similar claims associated with both medical and consumer devices, the possibility of consumer devices being repurposed for medical uses, and the potential for medical uses of neurotechnology to influence commercial markets related to employment and self-enhancement.},

  title={Modeling Traffic Control Agency Decision Behavior for Multimodal Manual Signal Control Under Event Occurrences}, 
  year={2015},

  number={5},
  pages={2467-2478},
  abstract={Traffic control agencies (TCAs), including police officers, firefighters, or other traffic law enforcement officers, can override automatic traffic signal control and manually control the traffic at an intersection. TCA-based traffic signal control is crucial to mitigate nonrecurrent traffic congestion caused by planned and unplanned events. Understanding and predicting TCA behaviors is significant to optimize event traffic management and operations. In this paper, we propose a pressure-based human behavior model to mimic TCA's decision-making behavior. The model calculates TCA's pressure based on two attributes: vehicle and pedestrian queue dynamics and the red time duration for each phase. When TCA's pressure on each phase meet certain criteria and the minimal green is satisfied, TCA will terminate the current phase and switch to another phase. In order to study TCA behavior systematically, we first build a manual signal control simulator based on a microscopic traffic simulation tool. Supported by the manual control simulator, a series of human subject experiments have been conducted with real-world TCAs. Experiment data are divided into training data and test data. The proposed behavior model is then calibrated by training data, and the model is validated by both offline segment-based phase and duration prediction and online VISSIM-based simulation. Further, we test the model with videotaped TCA behavior data at a real-world intersection. Both validation results support the effectiveness of proposed behavior model.},

  abstract={Recent augmented reality (AR) advancements have enabled the development of effective training systems, especially in the medical, rehabilitation, and industrial fields. However, it is unclear from the literature what the intrinsic value of AR to training is and how it differs across multiple application fields. In this work, we gathered and reviewed the prototypes and applications geared towards training the intended user's knowledge, skills, and abilities. Specifically, from IEEE Xplore plus other digital libraries, we collected 64 research papers present in high-impact publications about augmented reality training systems (ARTS). All 64 papers were then categorized according to the training method used, and each paper's evaluations were identified by validity. The summary of the results shows trends in the training methods and evaluations that incorporate ARTS in each field. The narrative synthesis illustrates the different implementations of AR for each of the training methods. In addition, examples of the different evaluation types of the current ARTS are described for each of the aforementioned training methods. We also investigated the different training strategies used by the prevailing ARTS. The insights gleaned from this review can suggest standards for designing ARTS regarding training strategy, and recommendations are provided for the implementation and evaluation of future ARTS.},

  pages={325-336},
  abstract={One effective approach for equipping artificial agents with sensorimotor skills is to use self-exploration. To do this efficiently is critical, as time and data collection are costly. In this study, we propose an exploration mechanism that blends action, object, and action outcome representations into a latent space, where local regions are formed to host forward model (FM) learning. The agent uses intrinsic motivation to select the FM with the highest learning progress (LP) to adopt at a given exploration step. This parallels how infants learn, as high LP indicates that the learning problem is neither too easy nor too difficult in the selected region. The proposed approach is validated with a simulated robot in a tabletop environment. The simulation scene comprises a robot and various objects, where the robot interacts with one of them each time using a set of parameterized actions and learns the outcomes of these interactions. With the proposed approach, the robot organizes its curriculum of learning as in existing intrinsic motivation approaches and outperforms them in learning speed. Moreover, the learning regime demonstrates features that partially match infant development; in particular, the proposed system learns to predict the outcomes of different skills in a staged manner.},

  pages={241-246},
  abstract={Serious games, due to their massiveness, attractiveness, and enjoyment, are widely used for education, promoting healthy behaviors, and for the prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STI). Serious game design includes tailored narratives, game mechanics, and art for their purpose. Nevertheless, using theories of attitude change to create a videogame to promote healthy behavior is less common. Following contemporary theories on persuasion, we developed and tested an RPG videogame for mobile phones, in which participants had to think in favor of the use of condoms through a series of tasks within the game in order to promote positive attitudes and consonant behavioral intention (BI). Results show a positive correlation between thoughts, attitudes, and BI, and that attitudes can partially mediate (account for) the association between thoughts and BI. In this exploratory study, we showed that 1) it was possible to include an Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM)-based approach into a videogame; 2) consistent with previous studies, attitudes partially mediated the association between thoughts and condom use (BI) in a videogame environment; and 3) applications of this strategy can be considered in the game design process to build new serious games for prevention in health care.},

  abstract={Regaining the lost functionality of limbs is the top priority for people with motor skills impairment as it directly affects their ability to execute activities of daily living and hence, worsens their quality of life. In the last two decades, a great deal of research has focused on error-related potential (ErrP) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Many applications have been developed to assist motor-impaired people in their rehabilitation and among these are robots, spellers, gesture recognition systems, and brain-controlled wheelchairs. In this paper, we present a review of various ErrP based BCI that can potentially aid motor-disabled people in their rehabilitation and execution of their daily activities. First, we describe the ErrP phenomenon and its characteristics followed by a comprehensive application-driven discussion on ErrP based rehabilitation and assistive strategies for motor-impaired people, including studies conducted since the inception of ErrP to the current state-of-the-art applications. Lastly, we discuss the potential issues and challenges being faced by current state-of-the-art applications as well as important future pathways and research directions that might be adopted for advanced ErrP-BCIs used in clinical settings.},

  abstract={The galvanic skin response (GSR), which is a manifestation of the activity in eccrine sweat glands, has always been an important psychological test to evaluate emotional arousal and mental stress. Although researches have focused on the radio reflections of skin and revealed that sweat gland activity can change the reflection signal of skin, the complicated experimental settings including vector network analyzer (VNA) and even optical path design limit further daily life application. In this article, we demonstrate the potential of using commodity millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar for contactless GSR sensing. To simulate the reflected signals of the frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar to the skin of different individuals, a four-layered skin model focused on the sweat duct is used and the change in conductivity in sweat ducts is regarded as mapping of sweat gland activity. Extensive experiments are conducted, consisting of three different physiological statuses: relaxing status, mental stress status, and physical stress status. We design a beamformer to transform the raw signal to the space domain so that the reflection signals from the palm are separated. The principal components of the processed signal are extracted to eliminate the interference caused by breathing and random noise. We evaluate the performance in terms of the correlation between the radar signal and the GSR before and after stress-induced events. The experimental results preliminarily verify the feasibility of contactless GSR sensing.},

  abstract={Virtual reality (VR) can be utilized to create video games exploring novel ways to control and interact with the environment. VR can be employed to revisit, extend, and enhance old video games to give them a new lease of life. In this article, we describe the game Countdown VR, in which players must use mental computation to reach a target number. Mental computation is used in everyday life, it is used for quick calculations and estimations. Countdown VR is a serious game designed and implemented using the learning mechanics–game mechanics framework. We provide an analysis of different approaches for determining the difficulty level of the game based on a number and target to attain and a selection of numbers combined to reach the target. We assess the user's performance and user's experience in the game, with questionnaires to quantify the related workload, usability, flow, motivation, and potential symptoms of users playing the game. The results provide key information related to the relationships between the subjective and objective evaluations of the proposed VR game by players, with a high correlation between VR sickness questionnaires, and moderate correlations between usability and motivation, flow, and motivation.},

  abstract={Despite the public enthusiasm for gamification training for employees, gamification is not yet been fully incorporated for instructor training in universities. Previous studies have examine factors that improves employee participation, motivation and engagement that leads to the employee intentions to use gamification for training. Therefore, in this study, task technology fit (TTF), social motivations (SM) and knowledge gain from using gamifiction were investigated. The TAM is enhanced with other factors; such as the task technology fit (TTF) and social motivation. The TTF is used to examine gamification utility, while social motivation is used to examine social influence (SI) and social recognition (SR). Data were collected in two phases, in the first phase 375 data were used for the TAM, secondly, 31 data were used for the pre and posttest. A structural equation model were presented to test the TAM while the t-test were used to study the knowledge gain from using the gamification system. However, the foundation for understanding instructors' behavior in this study's context are: (1) perceived usefulness and attitudes are crucial to the continuance intentions to use gamified Moodle for training; (2) perceived usefulness mediates the relationships among social recognition, TTF, perceived ease of use, and social influence on continuance intentions; (3) when predicting continuance intentions, TTF, social recognition, social influence, and perceived ease of use are vital; (4) TTF positively affects perceived ease of use; and, unexpectedly, (5) the TTF and social influence have no significant effects on perceived usefulness. Detailed results and educational implications are discussed.},

  abstract={Serious games are a promising approach for demand-side management that aims to higher user engagement and active participation. In this paper, we introduce the problem of optimal serious-game design for achieving specific energy-consumption reduction goals. We consider a serious game, where a serious-game designer entity presents publicly to all consumers a list of top-K consumers and a list of bottom-M consumers according to their respective energy-consumption reduction at peak hours. The driving forces of this serious game are the user discomfort due to demand load reduction, the user desire for social approval and the user sensitivity to social outcasting. We formulate the problems of the serious-game designer as an operational-cost minimization one for the utility company and that of each consumer as a utility-maximization one. The serious-game-design problem is to decide on K, M, and on the feedback provided to the consumers, while the consumer-side problem amounts to selecting the behavioral change to energy consumption that maximizes the expected user utility. By a series of simulations, we show how the choices of K, M affect the energy consumption reduction for different types of customers.},

  abstract={This article explores ways in which virtual environments can be used for crowdsourcing and behavior mining for filling gaps within the information space of topical research. Behavior mining in this article refers to the act of harvesting the latent or instinctive behavior of participants, usually a crowd, and injecting the population behavior into a preset context, such as within a virtual environment so that the subjective behaviors and the contexts are merged. The experimental approach combines various modalities centered upon virtual environments so as to induce presence in order to bring participants into the context. This approach is new and not well studied; however, it has real potential in research dealing with behaviors and culture in reconstructed virtual environments. Two virtual environments case studies at the 2012 and 2015 Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition are presented, which demonstrate that the unique crowdsourcing activity is able to fill gaps within the information space so that answers to research questions can be more complete. Thus, by reconstructing and replicating a lost landscape, and by injecting harvested human behavior into the context of the landscape, we may be able to gather much more information than conventional methods will allow.},
