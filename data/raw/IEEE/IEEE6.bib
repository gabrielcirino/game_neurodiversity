  abstract={We have studied experimentally the carp exploratory behavior in the circular corridor under uniform illumination and in the absence of external landmarks. The behavior was not uniform despite the uniformity of environment The alternation of two modes of behavior, search (accompanied by high turn frequency) and ranging (with few or no turns), was observed. The existence of distinct modes manifested itself in the positive correlation between turn frequencies at successive time intervals, as well as in abrupt switching between high and low turn frequencies. We developed a model based on the one-dimension map: X n = λn X n−1 (1X n−1), where X is the tendency to turn, and parameter λ is influenced by Gaussian white noise caused by spontaneous nervous activity. There was a correlation between successive values of the tendency, as well as switches from series of low values to series of high ones under influence of the noise. The behavior of the model is the case of noise-induced phase transitions and matches experimental data qualitatively. It is concluded that a noise generated by the nervous system can play a role in the shaping of animal behavior.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology and its successful application in various fields, modeling and simulation technology, especially multi-agent modeling and simulation (MAMS), of complex systems has rapidly advanced. In this study, we first describe the concept, technical advantages, research steps, and research status of MAMS. Then we review the development status of the hybrid modeling and simulation combining multi-agent and system dynamics, the modeling and simulation of multi-agent reinforcement learning, and the modeling and simulation of large-scale multi-agent. Lastly, we introduce existing MAMS platforms and their comparative studies. This work summarizes the current research situation of MAMS, thus helping scholars understand the systematic technology development of MAMS in the AI era. It also paves the way for further research on MAMS technology.},

  abstract={Simulation validation, demonstrating that a simulation accurately represents the system it studies, poses a particularly potent form of the oracle problem. A simulation must be validated for its results to be reliable, but often no oracle exists due to the nature of simulations. We propose taking the metamorphic testing (MT) approach from the realm of software verification and applying it for validating executable simulation models. By establishing pseudo-oracles based on metamorphic relations between parameters and behaviors within an executable model, we can create a methodical approach for validating simulation models. We propose an overall framework and guidelines to apply MT for simulation validation, with details for two prevalent simulation approaches: agent-based simulation models (ABM), and discrete-event simulation (DES) modeling. Through three case studies, we demonstrate the successful application of MT toward validating three different simulation models: an ABM of gossip propagation, an ABM of cancer, and a DES of airport check-in and security.},

  volume={1},

  pages={233-244},
  abstract={In interactive plan-based narrative environments, users' actions must be monitored to ensure that conditions necessary for the execution of narrative plans are not compromised. In the Zocalo system, management of user actions has been performed on a reactionary basis by a process called mediation. In this paper, we describe an extension to this approach, proactive mediation, which calculates responses to user input in an anticipatory manner. A proactive mediation module accepts as input a plan describing the actions being performed by the user (generated by a plan recognition system) and identifies portions of that plan that jeopardize the causal structure of the overall narrative. Once these portions are identified, proactive mediation generates modifications to the narrative plan structure that avoid the unwanted interaction between user and story. This extension to the original mediation algorithm provides more responses to a user's actions and generates responses that are tailored to the user's activity.},

  title={Analyzing the inconsistency in driving patterns between manual and autonomous modes under complex driving scenarios with a VR-enabled simulation platform}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={5},
  number={3},
  pages={215-234},
  abstract={Purpose - With the aid of naturalistic simulations, this paper aims to investigate human behavior during manual and autonomous driving modes in complex scenarios. Design/methodology/approach - The simulation environment is established by integrating virtual reality interface with a micro-simulation model. In the simulation, the vehicle autonomy is developed by a framework that integrates artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms. Human-subject experiments are carried, and participants are asked to virtually sit in the developed autonomous vehicle (AV) that allows for both human driving and autopilot functions within a mixed traffic environment. Findings - Not surprisingly, the inconsistency is identified between two driving modes, in which the AV's driving maneuver causes the cognitive bias and makes participants feel unsafe. Even though only a shallow portion of the cases that the AV ended up with an accident during the testing stage, participants still frequently intervened during the AV operation. On a similar note, even though the statistical results reflect that the AV drives under perceived high-risk conditions, rarely an actual crash can happen. This suggests that the classic safety surrogate measurement, e.g. time-to-collision, may require adjustment for the mixed traffic flow. Research limitations/implications - Understanding the behavior of AVs and the behavioral difference between AVs and human drivers are important, where the developed platform is only the first effort to identify the critical scenarios where the AVs might fail to react. Practical implications - This paper attempts to fill the existing research gap in preparing close-to-reality tools for AV experience and further understanding human behavior during high-level autonomous driving. Social implications - This work aims to systematically analyze the inconsistency in driving patterns between manual and autopilot modes in various driving scenarios (i.e. multiple scenes and various traffic conditions) to facilitate user acceptance of AV technology. Originality/value - A close-to-reality tool for AV experience and AV-related behavioral study. A systematic analysis in relation to the inconsistency in driving patterns between manual and autonomous driving. A foundation for identifying the critical scenarios where the AVs might fail to react.},

  abstract={Healthcare centers are ideal settings to identify and motivate parents to adhere to healthier lifestyles in order to reverse their child's excessive weight. However, such promotions are time- and resource-consuming, and primary health care needs new approaches to engage parents. In this article, we present an app for that purpose, with tailored recommendations for parents regarding young children's lifestyles (eating, drinking, moving, and sleeping habits) with gamification mechanics for parents, and a serious game for their children, aged 3–6 years. Healthcare center based questionnaires were used to assess parent's acceptance of the app. We also determined their enrollment and retention rates with a pilot study, in order to test the implementation of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in the future (pilot trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03881280). In the pilot study, we tested their engagement with the app during a four-week period through a monitoring website. In the acceptance test (n = 13), parents rated the app a median score of seven on a ten-point scale. In the pilot study (n = 21), all parents in the intervention group used the app. The retention rate was 71.4%. This study indicated some areas of improvement related to gaming mechanics in order to increase participation. Healthcare center's professionals and parents of children with overweight/obesity accepted this innovative approach. In addition, it is feasible to test its impact on children's lifestyle by conducting an RCT in the future.},

  abstract={For a disaster whose scale includes an urban area, it is difficult to be studied with physical experiments. Numerical simulation is found a very efficient tool for such problem. This paper aims at developing an integrated urban earthquake simulation system (UESS) that uses GIS as the model source, CAD as the model generating tools, FEA as damage prediction, and virtual reality (VR) as the post-process platform. An automatic procedure was developed to buildup the 3D structural model of buildings in an urban area, as well as to simulate their earthquake performances, from the digital map of GIS. And the simulation results were presented in an integrated interface with a GIS view-port for position finding, a CAD view-port for 3D structural damage identification, and a VR view-port for 3D dynamic structural vibration display. An urban example with more than 7000 buildings was select to demonstrate the feasibility of proposed system.},

  pages={32033-32052},
  abstract={Online Impulse Buying Behavior (IBB) significantly increases and contributes to the total S-commerce revenue. Hence, understanding such behavior is critical for an online business to strengthen competitiveness, enhance revenue, and ensure business sustainability. The majority of the prior research used urge-to-buy (UBI) to examine online IBB instead of the actual IBB. Hence, the studies that differentiate between UBI and IBB are limited. Moreover, these studies have concentrated on the impact of consumer characteristics, website, and marketing factors, but they neglected the role of social factors. This study integrated Social Influence and Uses and Gratifications Theories to explore the social factors affecting online IBB. The findings indicate that social influences, entertainment, purposive value, and maintaining interpersonal connectivity influence IBB significantly. UBI also mediates the relationships between social influences and IBB. Impulsiveness moderates the indirect relationships between compliance, internalization, and IBB through UBI. This study has practical implications for social commerce designers, marketers, and managers.},

  abstract={For many decades, the popular narrative surrounding anorexia nervosa was that it was an emotional disorder springing from profound cultural pressures combined with dysfunctional family dynamics. Teenage girls, typically, would refuse to eat in an obsessive bid to lose weight. They would imagine themselves to be fat, even if mirrors and scales demonstrated otherwise. Because of the surfeit of images of rail-thin preteen models cluttering the pages of trendy fashion magazines, it was easy to imagine this theory to be true. It made sense if some clinicians regarded anorexia as the inevitable result of a “you-can-never-be-too-rich-or-too-thin” culture.},

  year={2018},
  volume={26},

  pages={3276-3288},
  abstract={In large-scale group decision making (GDM), noncooperative behavior in the consensus reaching process (CRP) is not unusual. For example, some individuals might form a small alliance with the aim to refuse attempts to modify their preferences or even to move them against consensus to foster the alliance's own interests. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on a self-management mechanism for noncooperative behaviors in large-scale CRPs (LCRPs). In the proposed consensus reaching framework, experts are classified into different subgroups using a clustering method, and experts provide their evaluation information, i.e., the multicriteria mutual evaluation matrices (MCMEMs), regarding the subgroups based on subgroups' performance (e.g., professional skills, cooperation, and fairness). The subgroups' weights are dynamically generated from the MCMEMs, which are in turn employed to update the individual experts' weights. This self-management mechanism in the LCRP allows penalizing the weights of the experts with noncooperative behaviors. Detailed simulation experiments and comparison analysis are presented to verify the validity of the proposed framework for managing noncooperative behaviors in the LCRP.},

  title={Dynamics of Learning in Multilayer Perceptrons Near Singularities}, 
  year={2008},
  volume={19},

  pages={1313-1328},
  abstract={The dynamical behavior of learning is known to be very slow for the multilayer perceptron, being often trapped in the "plateau." It has been recently understood that this is due to the singularity in the parameter space of perceptrons, in which trajectories of learning are drawn. The space is Riemannian from the point of view of information geometry and contains singular regions where the Riemannian metric or the Fisher information matrix degenerates. This paper analyzes the dynamics of learning in a neighborhood of the singular regions when the true teacher machine lies at the singularity. We give explicit asymptotic analytical solutions (trajectories) both for the standard gradient (SGD) and natural gradient (NGD) methods. It is clearly shown, in the case of the SGD method, that the plateau phenomenon appears in a neighborhood of the critical regions, where the dynamical behavior is extremely slow. The analysis of the NGD method is much more difficult, because the inverse of the Fisher information matrix diverges. We conquer the difficulty by introducing the "blow-down" technique used in algebraic geometry. The NGD method works efficiently, and the state converges directly to the true parameters very quickly while it staggers in the case of the SGD method. The analytical results are compared with computer simulations, showing good agreement. The effects of singularities on learning are thus qualitatively clarified for both standard and NGD methods.},

  year={2019},
  volume={11},

  pages={5-14},
  abstract={Programming by demonstration (PbD) has a straightforward application in the development of the artificial intelligence (AI) for nonplayer characters (NPCs) in a video game: a game designer controls the NPC during a training session in the game, and thus demonstrates the expected behavior for that character in different situations. Afterwards, applying some machine learning technique on the traces recorded during the demonstration, an AI for the NPC can be generated. Nevertheless, with this approach, it is very hard for the game designer to fully control the resulting behavior, which is a key requirement for game designers, who are responsible for putting together a fun experience for the player. In this paper, we present trained behavior trees (TBTs). TBTs are behavior trees (BTs) generated from traces obtained in a game through PbD. BTs are a technique widely used for AI game programming that are created and modified through special purpose visual editors. By inducing a BT from a PbD game session, we combine the ease of use of PbD with the ability to fine-tune the learned behavior of BTs. Furthermore, TBTs facilitate the use of BTs by game designers and promote their authoring control on game AI.},

  title={Memory-Based Human Motion Simulation for Computer-Aided Ergonomic Design}, 
  year={2008},
  volume={38},
  number={3},
  pages={513-527},
  abstract={ A novel memory-based motion simulation (MBMS) model was developed as a general framework for simulating natural human motions for computer-aided ergonomic design. The MBMS model utilizes real human motion samples recorded in motion capture experiments as templates for simulating novel motions. Such human motion samples are stored in a motion database. When a user submits an input simulation scenario to the model, a motion search engine termed the “root motion finder” in the model searches the motion database and retrieves the motion samples that closely match the given scenario. The retrieved motions, referred to as root motions, may significantly differ from one another in the underlying movement technique. Such variability within the root motion set is analyzed and graphically summarized by a model component termed the motion variability analyzer. This analysis helps users rapidly identify alternative movement techniques for the given input simulation scenario and simulate human motions based on alternative movement techniques. Since root motions do not exactly satisfy but only closely match the input simulation scenario, a motion modification (MoM) algorithm adapts them to fit the scenario by systematically deforming them in the joint angle–time domain. The MoM algorithm retains the root motions' fundamental spatial–temporal structure and minimizes deviations from the root motions during such deformations. The MBMS model overcomes limitations of existing simulation models and achieves the following: 1) simulation of categorically different motions based on a single unified model; 2) simple and efficient learning of new motion behaviors; and 3) representation and simulation of human motion variability. },

  abstract={We have investigated magnetization switching behavior in high-data-rate hard-disk media by micro-magnetic simulation. We found that the remanence coercivity measured by a short-pulse-field depended on the field-pulse shape. The time integration of external field over the remanent coercivity for a long-pulse-field, namely switching force integration (SFI), was an essential factor for the switching. We also found that the optimum writing field, H/sub w/ must be increased by only 0.4 kA/m per MB/s independent of the linear recording density. Overwrite (OW) value decreased by 1 dB per percentage point of H/sub w/ and did not depend on the data-transfer rate. The recording characteristics at high data transfer rates were not degraded if only a writing field of H/sub w/ was applied to the film. The simulation results were consistent with the results of read/write experiments especially OW characteristics up to 80 MB/s.},

  abstract={We characterize the line-of-sight (LOS) link availability in indoor visible light communication (VLC) networks based on the behavior of human users. The VLC link availability is impacted by humans in three distinct ways: (1) Users turn the lights on or off in each room. (2) Users may carry mobile devices. (3) Users constitute mobile obstacles that block or shadow the channel between the transmitter and the receiver. First, we develop a mathematical framework for VLC link availability and a probabilistic model of the VLC network with respect to human behavior in indoor environments. Second, we design a realistic multi-user, indoor VLC system simulation with static and mobile VLC devices that are expected to be found in smart home environments. We present the following four sets of results: (1) We report statistics on the blockage durations of VLC links and categorize the links with respect to these statistics. (2) We demonstrate the performance of Selection Diversity versus Maximal Ratio Combining for mobile VLC devices carried by humans in a smart home setting. (3) We show that optimal LED resource allocation policies for multiple users are impacted by the VLC link blockage events caused by humans. (4) We demonstrate that the link blockage events in different rooms become dependent due to humans who transition between rooms. Based on our results, we provide new directions for the design of network architectures for indoor VLC systems.},

  abstract={Stroke is affecting different age groups worldwide with tremendous consequences. Most stroke survivors suffer from motor impairment, where rehabilitation helps to regain lost abilities. Rehabilitation is a long process that focuses on repeating exercises, which are monotonous and time consuming. As a consequence, patients loose interest and motivation. Serious games offer the possibility to deliver rehabilitation exercises in combination with entertaining and motivating aspects. A variety of serious games using additional hardware is available to support stroke patients. In this article, the authors propose a new and innovative serious game, which relies only on integrated sensors of a smartphone. Development was based on a user-centered design approach divided into two phases. In phase 1, requirements were identified in cooperation with a therapist and 13 stroke patients. The developed serious game included different levels of difficulty for movement, gesture, and touch exercises. Additional feedback and requirements from therapists and medical doctors were included in phase 2, which resulted in an advanced solution with additional levels. Gathered feedback showed a positive attitude toward the proposed solution.},

  abstract={To facilitate effective human-robot interaction (HRI), trust-aware HRI has been proposed, wherein the robotic agent explicitly considers the human's trust during its planning and decision making. The success of trust-aware HRI depends on the specification of a trust dynamics model and a trust-behavior model. In this study, we proposed one novel trust-behavior model, namely the reverse psychology model, and compared it against the commonly used disuse model. We examined how the two models affect the robot's optimal policy and the human-robot team performance. Results indicate that the robot will deliberately “manipulate” the human's trust under the reverse psychology model. To correct this “manipulative” behavior, we proposed a trust-seeking reward function that facilitates trust establishment without significantly sacrificing the team performance.},

  pages={1045-1056},
  abstract={Immersive virtual reality (IVR) technology influences students’ cognitive processes and affective experience, according to previous research findings. Yet, empirical studies that investigate the impact of IVR on science education in secondary schools are limited. This article reports a pilot study that has two objectives: First, to investigate whether learning science with IVR leads to more positive learning outcomes than that with a traditional video-viewing activity; and second, to investigate whether corrective feedback produces more positive learning outcomes than explanatory feedback in IVR-mediated contexts. A randomized, controlled pilot trial was designed during a school year at a secondary school in western China. Forty-seven participatory students were randomly assigned to a control group (learning with instructional videos, n = 17), an intervention group 1 (learning with IVR with corrective feedback, n = 15), and an intervention group 2 (learning with IVR with explanatory feedback, n = 15). We evaluated an array of student learning-related outcomes, including extraneous and germane cognitive loads, intrinsic learning motivation, academic self-efficacy, learner satisfaction, and academic achievement. The results revealed a significant difference in intrinsic learning motivation, academic self-efficacy, learner satisfaction, and academic achievement, but an insignificant difference in extraneous and germane cognitive loads when students learned with video and IVR. In terms of the type of feedback provided in IVR-mediated environments, students who were prompted with corrective feedback and explanatory feedback showed little difference in their learning outcomes. The reasons related to the findings and limitations are discussed.},

  abstract={This paper introduces new results on the modeling of early vocal development using artificial intelligent cognitive architectures and a simulated vocal tract. The problem is addressed using intrinsically motivated learning algorithms for autonomous sensorimotor exploration, a kind of algorithm belonging to the active learning architectures family. The artificial agent is able to autonomously select goals to explore its own sensorimotor system in regions, where its competence to execute intended goals is improved. We propose to include a somatosensory system to provide a proprioceptive feedback signal to reinforce learning through the autonomous discovery of motor constraints. Constraints are represented by a somatosensory model which is unknown beforehand to the learner. Both the sensorimotor and somatosensory system are modeled using Gaussian mixture models. We argue that using an architecture which includes a somatosensory model would reduce redundancy in the sensorimotor model and drive the learning process more efficiently than algorithms taking into account only auditory feedback. The role of this proposed system is to predict whether an undesired collision within the vocal tract under a certain motor configuration is likely to occur. Thus, compromised motor configurations are rejected, guaranteeing that the agent is less prone to violate its own constraints.},

  year={2008},
  volume={20},
  number={5},
  pages={906-915},
  abstract={In an event-related potential experiment with Chinese discourses as material, we investigated how and when accentuation influences spoken discourse comprehension in relation to the different information states of the critical words. These words could either provide new or old information. It was shown that variation of accentuation influenced the amplitude of the N400, with a larger amplitude for accented than for deaccented words. In addition, there was an interaction between accentuation and information state. The N400 amplitude difference between accented and deaccented new information was smaller than that between accented and deaccented old information. The results demonstrate that, during spoken discourse comprehension, listeners rapidly extract the semantic consequences of accentuation in relation to the previous discourse context. Moreover, our results show that the N400 amplitude can be larger for correct (new, accented words) than incorrect (new, deaccented words) information. This, we argue, proves that the N400 does not react to semantic anomaly per se, but rather to semantic integration load, which is higher for new information.},

  title={Solution Density and Search Strategy in Narrative Generation}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={14},
  number={4},
  pages={715-724},
  abstract={Intelligent interactive narrative systems coordinate a cast of nonplayer characters to make the overall story experience meaningful for the player. Narrative generation involves a tradeoff between plot-structure requirements and quality of character behavior, as well as computational efficiency. We study this tradeoff using the example of benchmark problems for narrative planning algorithms. A typical narrative planning problem calls for a sequence of actions that leads to an overall plot goal being met, while also requiring each action to respect constraints that create the appearance of character autonomy. We consider simplified solution definitions that enforce only plot requirements or only character requirements, and we measure how often each of these definitions leads to a solution that happens to meet both types of requirements—i.e., the density with which narrative plans occur among plot- or character-requirement-satisfying sequences. We then investigate whether solution densities can guide the selection of narrative planning algorithms. We compare the performance of two search strategies: one that satisfies plot requirements first and checks character requirements afterward, and one that continuously verifies character requirements. Our results show that comparing solution densities does not by itself predict which of these search strategies will be more efficient in terms of search nodes visited, suggesting that other important factors exist. We discuss what some of these factors could be. Our work opens further investigation into characterizing narrative planning algorithms and how they interact with specific domains. The results also highlight the diversity and difficulty of solving narrative planning problems.},

  pages={120226-120238},
  abstract={Research on multi-agent systems has extensively modeled real-world phenomena across various domains including epidemiology, urban planning, and financial transactions. These systems often struggle to produce agent behaviors that comprehensively capture the dynamics of the real-world ecosystem and the unique behaviors of each agent type. Furthermore, the limited explainability of these models due to non-iterative calibration poses significant challenges. This paper introduces an iterative model calibration algorithm that dynamically adjusts the multitude of parameters in a multi-agent simulation platform. Initially treating the simulation model as a black box, our method refines simulation parameters through cycles of adjustments based on clusters of observed behaviors comprising the behavior of both agents and actors. This approach allows for the identification and correction of inaccuracies, introduces new parameters, and discards erroneous ones within the agent-based model as demonstrated in a Mobile Money Transaction Simulator (MoMTSim). The calibration algorithm enhances the realism and applicability of the simulation model by ensuring that the generated synthetic datasets closely mirror real transaction data. The effectiveness of this calibration method was determined by validating the generated data through comparing the real and synthetic datasets using statistical methods including the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the sum of squared errors (SSE) method, and Bland-Altman plots. We computed the delta between the real and synthetic data using the SSE approach and found that the synthetic datasets resemble real data. This shows that MoMTSim effectively generates synthetic data that closely matches real mobile money transaction data, validating the accuracy of our model calibration algorithm in simulating complex financial ecosystems.},

  abstract={People connected by huge-size socialnetworks are highly dependent on recommendation systems to discover interesting persons, contents, and commodities. Extracting user interests and modeling their evolutions from user historical behavior are vital for algorithms to judge whether users are interested in given persons and items. The existing methods have two shortcomings: firstly, they do not have the high-order ability to process temporal sequences, which leads to their inability to mine the evolution of user interests; secondly, the models take full large-scale information of items as input, which causes a severe problem of overfitting. Thus, we propose a new hybrid neural network, DGRU, which integrates Factorization-Machine Based Neural Network (DeepFM) and Gated Recurrent Unit Neural Network (GRU). The DeepFM component is responsible for performing the autonomic feature combination, and the GRU component is designed to model user interests and evolutions. The GRU component is fed with a series of 1 and 0 representing user click behaviors. It contains information on what users like and dislike. Moreover, the conciseness of the format is helpful to avoid the problem of overfitting. Experiments on three real datasets demonstrated that the proposed model has a better CTR prediction performance and robustness than the state-of-the-art models.},

The experimental STDP plot (change in weight against △t = tpost - tpre) of a traditional FG synapse from previous studies shows a depression instead of potentiation at some range of positive values of △t-we call this non-STDP behavior. In this brief, we first analyze theoretically the reason for this anomaly and then present a simple solution based on changing control gate waveforms of the FG device to make the weight change conform closely to biological observations over a wide range of parameters. The experimental results from an FG synapse fabricated in AMS 0.35-μm CMOS process design are also presented to justify the claim. Finally, we present the simulation results of a circuit designed to create the modified gate voltage waveform.},

  year={2011},
  volume={12},

  pages={354-363},
  abstract={Driving simulators are very suitable test beds for the evaluation and development of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). However, the impact of such systems on the behavior of individual drivers can properly be analyzed through driving simulators only if autonomous vehicles in the driving scenario move according to the system under evaluation. This condition means that the simulation of the traffic surrounding the interactive vehicle should already take into account the driver's behavior as affected by the system under analysis. Currently, this “loop” is not properly tackled, because the effects on individuals and traffic are, in general, separately and, often, independently evaluated. The integration of traffic and driving simulations, instead, may provide a more consistent solution to this challenging evaluation problem. It also opens up new scenarios for enhancing the credibility of both traffic modeling and driving simulation and for their combined development. For instance, because drivers directly interact with driver/traffic models in a driving simulation environment, such models may also be tested against nonnormative behavior, and this case seems the only way to test driver/traffic models for safety applications. Based on this idea, this paper describes the integration of a driving simulation engine known as SCANeR and a traffic-flow microsimulation model known as AIMSUN. Methodological and technical issues of such integration are first presented, and future enhancements for higher consistency of the simulation environments are finally envisaged.},

  abstract={Analyzing user behavior characteristics in a complex power grid environment is essential for user behavior planning and resource coordination optimization. Traditional user behavior analysis methods based on model-driven and causal analysis have the disadvantages of strong subjectivity and physical models that are difficult to deal with the randomness and uncertainty of user behavior in complex grid environments. In this paper, we use unsupervised learning methods to analyze user behavior in complex power grid environments, and propose user behavior analysis methods based on stacked autoencoder and clustering. We first reduce the complexity of user behavior data by proposing adaptive feature selection algorithm of user behavior based on stacked autoencoder and unsupervised learning (AFS-SAEUL). Finally, we build a user behavior analysis model based on adaptive feature selection and improved clustering (UBA-AFSIC). The model improved the performance of unsupervised classification of user behavior by fusing the adaptive generation strategy of the initial cluster centers. The simulation experiment results on two real electricity datasets and one public electric vehicle charging dataset show that compared with the existing feature selection algorithm and clustering algorithm, the algorithms proposed in this paper have higher feature selection rate and better clustering performance.},

The HTS SQUIDs are required to have high robustness with respect to the magnetic noise for stable operation in an unshielded environment and also reduced cost to widen the application range. It is, therefore, necessary to clarify the quantum magnetic behavior of the HTS SQUID. However, a simulation tool, which can consider the quantum magnetic behavior, has not been developed yet. In this paper, an equivalent circuit of a Josephson junction comprising the HTS SQUID is more properly considered to represent the quantum behavior. It can consider the ac and dc Josephson effect. The obtained results are compared with an ordinary simulation using a simplified circuit model, and the results agree well with each other. Using the proposed simulation method instead of the ordinary simulation, the current path is more accurately simulated, so this new method will be used to evaluate the robustness of the SQUID.},

  abstract={This paper presents a comparative study of approaches to control robots with variable impedance actuators (VIAs) in ways that imitate the behavior of humans. We focus on problems where impedance modulation strategies are recorded from human demonstrators for transfer to robotic systems with differing levels of heterogeneity, both in terms of the dynamics and actuation. We categorize three classes of approach that may be applied to this problem, namely, 1) direct, 2) feature-based, and 3) inverse optimal approaches to transfer. While the first is restricted to highly biomorphic plants, the latter two are shown to be sufficiently general to be applied to various VIAs in a way that is independent of the mechanical design. As instantiations of such transfer schemes, 1) a constraint-based method and 2) an apprenticeship learning framework are proposed, and their suitability to different problems in robotic imitation, in terms of efficiency, ease of use, and task performance, is characterized. The approaches are compared in simulation on systems of varying complexity, and robotic experiments are reported for transfer of behavior from human electromyographic data to two different variable passive compliance robotic devices.},

  abstract={The interest for surgery simulator systems with anatomical models generated from authentic patient data is growing as these systems evolve. With access to volumetric patient data, e.g., from a computer tomography scan, haptic and visual feedback can be created directly from this dataset. This opens the door for patient specific simulations. Hip fracture surgery is one area where simulator systems is useful to train new surgeons and plan operations. To simulate the drilling procedure in this type of surgery, a repositioning of the fractured bone into correct position is first needed. This requires a segmentation process in which the bone segments are identified and the position of the dislocated part is determined. The segmentation must be automatic to cope with the large amount of data from the computer tomography scan. This work presents the first steps in the development of a hip fracture surgery simulation with patient specific models. Visual and haptic feedback is generated from the computer tomography data by simulating fluoroscopic images and the drilling process. We also present an automatic segmentation method to identify the fractured bone and determine the dislocation. This segmentation method is based on nonrigid registration with the Morphon method.},

  abstract={Virtual traffic benefits a variety of applications, including video games, traffic engineering, autonomous driving, and virtual reality. To date, traffic visualization via different simulation models can reconstruct detailed traffic flows. However, each specific behavior of vehicles is always described by establishing an independent control model. Moreover, mutual interactions between vehicles and other road users are rarely modeled in existing simulators. An all-in-one simulator that considers the complex behaviors of all potential road users in a realistic urban environment is urgently needed. In this work, we propose a novel, extensible, and microscopic method to build heterogeneous traffic simulation using the force-based concept. This force-based approach can accurately replicate the sophisticated behaviors of various road users and their interactions in a simple and unified manner. We calibrate the model parameters using real-world traffic trajectory data. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through many simulation experiments, as well as comparisons to real-world traffic data and popular microscopic simulators for traffic animation.},

  abstract={We have analyzed the device behavior of a poly-Si thin-film transistor (TFT) with a lightly doped drain (LDD) structure using 2-D device simulation. It is found that the reason that the on current does not fall very much is that the electron channel oozes from the channel region to the LDD region and the electric current paths spread to the entire LDD region. On the other hand, the reason that the off current is effectively reduced is undoubtedly that the electric field at the interface between the channel and LDD regions is weakened. However, it should be noted that the depletion region is formed at the drain edge owing to the “pseudo” space-charge region in the channel region, where the carrier density is much lower than in the other channel region, although the net space-charge does not exist.},

  abstract={Using large application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), typically with at least 50,000 (50K) gates, is on the rise. Hardware design methodology has turned to CAE (computer-aided engineering) tools to simulate and verify performance. These tools are usually called hardware description languages (HDLs). Digital systems are becoming increasingly complex. Simulating designs using conventional or optimized (sequential) HDL simulators, or even specialized hardware accelerators, cannot keep up with this growth. It is not unusual for a single simulation run with one test vector for a 50K ASIC design to take hours. This definitely increases the hardware design cost and prolongs the time-to-market. One solution to this time problem is to reduce the total amount of simulation that is done, or simply to simulate a less complex model. However, this increases the risk of producing a faulty circuit. Unfortunately, these methods are quite common in today's competitive hardware design industry. The company that first releases a new and better design is the one most likely to survive. Hence, there are some serious doubts in the hardware design community that existing HDL tools are suitable for large, complex designs. However, ways exist to improve the situation. One approach we believe is promising is to use parallel simulation methodologies.},

  abstract={Numerous research efforts have been conducted to simulate the crowd movements, while relatively few of them are specifically focused on multihazard situations. In this paper, we propose a novel crowd simulation method by modeling the generation and contagion of panic emotion under multihazard circumstances. In order to depict the effect from hazards and other agents to crowd movement, we first classify hazards into different types (transient and persistent, concurrent and nonconcurrent, and static and dynamic) based on their inherent characteristics. Second, we introduce the concept of perilous field for each hazard and further transform the critical level of the field to its invoked-panic emotion. After that, we propose an emotional contagion model to simulate the evolving process of panic emotion caused by multiple hazards. Finally, we introduce an emotional reciprocal velocity obstacles (RVOs) model to simulate the crowd behaviors by augmenting the traditional RVO model with emotional contagion, which for the first time combines the emotional impact and local avoidance together. Our experimental results demonstrate that the overall approach is robust, can better generate realistic crowds and the panic emotion dynamics in a crowd. Furthermore, it is recommended that our method can be applied to various complex multihazard environments.},

  pages={1995-2002},
  abstract={The design of collaborative learning (CL) scenarios that increase both students' learning and motivation is a challenge that the Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) community has been addressing in the past few years. On one hand, CSCL design (i.e. scripts) has shown to be an effective approach to support meaningful interactions and better learning. On the other hand, scripted collaboration sometimes decrease motivation of students to participate in the CL process, which makes more difficult the use of group activities over time. To deal with the problem of motivation, researchers and educators are now looking at Gamification techniques to engage students. Gamification in education is a complex task that requires, from instructional designers, knowledge about game elements (such as leaderboards and point systems), game design (how to combine game elements) and their impact on motivation and learning. To help the adequate use of gamification in collaborative learning activities we have applied ontological engineering techniques to develop an Ontology called OntoGaCLeS in order to formalize the representation of gamification concepts and explain how they affect motivation in CL situations. This paper will present the ontological structure to represent gamified CL scenarios and show the utility of our approach to define personalized conceptual models to gamify CL scenario based on students' needs and individual characteristics.},

  abstract={Exploration of indoor environments has recently experienced a significant interest, also thanks to the introduction of deep neural agents built in a hierarchical fashion and trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) on simulated environments. Current state-of-the-art methods employ a dense extrinsic reward that requires the complete a priori knowledge of the layout of the training environment to learn an effective exploration policy. However, such information is expensive to gather in terms of time and resources. In this work, we propose to train the model with a purely intrinsic reward signal to guide exploration, which is based on the impact of the robot’s actions on its internal representation of the environment. So far, impact-based rewards have been employed for simple tasks and in procedurally generated synthetic environments with countable states. Since the number of states observable by the agent in realistic indoor environments is non-countable, we include a neural-based density model and replace the traditional count-based regularization with an estimated pseudo-count of previously visited states. The proposed exploration approach outperforms DRL-based competitors relying on intrinsic rewards and surpasses the agents trained with a dense extrinsic reward computed with the environment layouts. We also show that a robot equipped with the proposed approach seamlessly adapts to point-goal navigation and real-world deployment.},

  abstract={An essay-based discourse analysis system can help students improve their writing by identifying relevant essay-based discourse elements in their essays. Our discourse analysis software, which is embedded in Criterion, an online essay evaluation application, uses machine learning to identify discourse elements in student essays. The system makes decisions that exemplify how teachers perform this task. For instance, when grading student essays, teachers comment on the discourse structure. Teachers might explicitly state that the essay lacks a thesis statement or that an essay's single main idea has insufficient support. Training the systems to model this behavior requires human judges to annotate a data sample of student essays. The annotation schema reflects the highly structured discourse of genres such as persuasive writing. Our discourse analysis system uses a voting algorithm that takes into account the discourse labeling decisions of three independent systems.},

  abstract={In this article, we report on the emergent narrative concept aiming at the definition of a narrative theory adapted to the VR medium (whether a game or VR application). The inherent freedom of movement proper to VR - an indisputable element of immersion - collides with the Aristotelian vision of articulated plot events with respect to the given timeline associated with the story in display. This narrative paradox can only be observed in interactive VR applications and it doesn't seem possible to resolve it through the use of existing narrative theories. Interactivity is the novel element that storytellers must address. The authors discuss designing unscripted dramas with affectively driven intelligent autonomous characters based on the development of the FearNot! system for education against bullying.},

Gamification has been proven to be a promising tool that offers many innovative solutions for various domains. This study presents a systematic literature review (SLR) of research studies involving gamification for recruitment, engagement, and training of employees. The SLR has been synthesized by reviewing carefully selected research studies published between 2014 and 2019 in well-reputed venues. Apart from reviewing the state-of-the-art studies on gamified solutions for recruiting and job training problems, a taxonomy of gaming elements based on the context of use in different environments has also been proposed. Similarly, the gamification model to develop gamified solutions to problems has also been presented. Lastly, the research gaps in terms of open issues have been presented to provide future directions for the researchers in the area of gamified solutions for recruitment and job training.},

  abstract={With the development of modern cities, metro are playing an increasingly important role in urban traffic. A biochemical terrorist attack in a metro station can cause many casualties. Therefore, more attention should be paid to metro emergency management. This paper presents a guidance scheme based on an improved empirical formula to optimize emergency evacuation. Additionally, the guidance evacuation model combined the social force model with pedestrian characteristics to study the influence of pedestrian behaviors on guidance evacuation. The experiment results show the following: (1) A guidance scheme based on an improved empirical formula can significantly reduce the casualties and improve the efficiency of evacuation; (2) The guidance evacuation model can be used to find the reasonable guidance locations and the combination of guides. (3) Pedestrian characteristics must be taken into account in the research of the guidance evacuation. Analyzing the behavioral characteristics of pedestrian can provide improvement measures for guidance evacuation. This paper focuses on the simulation experiments of emergency evacuation in metro station, which can provide practical references for developing an efficient and safe emergency evacuation scheme.},

  abstract={Compared to conventional visual- and auditory-based assisted driving technologies, haptic modality promises to be more effective and less disturbing assistance to the driver. However, in most previous studies, haptic assistance systems were evaluated from safety and stability viewpoints. Moreover, the effect of haptic assistance on human driving behavior has not been sufficiently discussed. In this paper, we introduce an assisted driving method based on haptic assistance for driver training in reverse parking, which is considered as an uncertain factor in conventional assisted driving systems. The proposed system assists the driver by applying a torque on the steering wheel to guide proper and well-timed steering. To design the appropriate assistance method, we conducted a measurement experiment to determine the qualitative reverse parking driver characteristics. Based on the determined characteristics, we propose a haptic assistance calculation method that utilizes the receding horizon control algorithm. For a simulation environment to assess the proposed assistance method, we also developed a scaled car simulator comprising a 1/10 scaled robot car and an omnidirectional camera. We used the scaled car simulator to conduct comparative experiments on subjects, and observed that the driving skills of the assisted subjects were significantly better than those of the control subjects.},

  abstract={Driver behavior is a concerning issue in the area of intelligent transportation system (ITS). Driver behavior is a significant key player in a wide range of unpleasant events during the ride, such as accidents or crashes, traffic congestion, harsh braking, and acceleration/deceleration. Influencing factors of driver behavior have been explored in several studies. It is imperative to investigate these factors in order to provide a comprehensive analysis and to categorize them on the basis of a coherent taxonomy. With that, this study conducted a systematic review on prior studies that focused on bus driver behavior, particularly in the ITS. This study also established a taxonomy on the topic of driver behavior in multiple areas of ITS and their classifications. Different databases, namely ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and IEEE Explore, were utilized to obtain relevant articles from 2008 to 2021 (15 April). Several filtering and scanning stages were performed according to the exclusion/inclusion criteria on all 2,803 articles obtained; however, only 87 articles met the criteria. The final set of articles were categorized into a taxonomy. The first part of the taxonomy focuses on five main factors that influence driver behavior: environmental, demographic, habit, vehicle, and on-road routine factors. The second part of the taxonomy discusses the mapping of data collection methods on the basis of four categories: real-time data collection, survey, simulation, and benchmark. Discussion and analysis were provided to highlight the critical literature gaps on bus driver behavior in the ITS, involving the use of real-time data collection, which is imperative for acquiring highly accurate and sophisticated data. This multi-field systematic review has exposed new research opportunities, motivations, challenges, limitations, and recommendations and highlighted the need for the synergistic integration of interdisciplinary works. Overall, this study presented pathways solution in future direction on the basis of three sequenced phases, namely design, labeling and validation, and machine learning. This study can serve as a guide for future researchers, as it addressed the ambiguities in the ITS-driver behavior domain and provided valuable information on these ITS-driver behavior trends.},

  abstract={Current nanometer CMOS circuits show an increasing sensitivity to deviations in first-order parameters and suffer from process variations during manufacturing. To properly assess and support test validation of digital designs, low-level fault simulation approaches are utilized to accurately capture the behavior of CMOS cells under parametric faults and process variations as early as possible throughout the design phase. However, low-level simulation approaches exhibit a high computational complexity, especially when variation has to be taken into account. In this paper, a high-throughput parallel fault simulation at switch level is presented. First-order electrical parameters are utilized to capture CMOS-specific functional and timing behavior of complex cells allowing to model faults with transistor granularity and without the need of logic abstraction. Furthermore, variation modeling in cells and transistor devices enables broad and efficient variation analyses of faults over many circuit instances for the first time. The simulation approach utilizes massive parallelization on graphics processing units by exploiting parallelism from cells, stimuli, faults, and circuit instances. Despite the lower abstraction levels of the approach, it processes designs with millions of gates and outperforms conventional fault simulation at logic level in terms of speed and accuracy.},

  abstract={This paper presents an extended cell transmission model to simulate an emergency evacuation of crowd in a supermarket scenario. The supermarket scenario with a daily shopping, an emergency exit and multiple parallel shelves is discretized into a set of regular hexagonal cells. First, we verify the validity of the model by comparing the results of the model with actual data obtained from a reported pedestrian evacuation experiment. To improve the realism of the simulation, we then include three characteristics of human behavior, the unadventurous effect, inertial effect, and panic psychology, in the model as parameters and apply the extended model to the supermarket scenario. By analyzing the pedestrian density distribution, fundamental diagrams, route choice, and total evacuation time, we determine that the parameters have a significant influence on the evacuation process. By establishing a minimization model, we confirm that the total evacuation time is the least when the pedestrians' familiarity with the emergency exit is close to the ratio of the width of the emergency exit to the total width of the two exits. Moreover, by comparing two different methods to choose exits, we can conclude that the approach, by which all pedestrians choose the closer exit, is not always the most efficient evacuation strategy. This study is conducive to devise evacuation plans and design exit layouts in facilities similar to supermarkets.},

  year={2017},

  abstract={Combat system effectiveness simulation (CSES) is a special type of complex system simulation. Three non-functional requirements (NFRs), i.e. model composability, domain specific modeling, and model evolvability, are gaining higher priority from CSES users when evaluating different modeling methodologies for CSES. Traditional CSES modeling methodologies are either domain-neutral (lack of domain characteristics consideration and limited support for model composability) or domain-oriented (lack of openness and evolvability) and fall short of the three NFRs. Inspired by the concept of architecture in systems engineering and software engineering fields, we extend it into a concept of model architecture for complex simulation systems, and propose a model architecture-oriented modeling methodology in which the model architecture plays a central role in achieving the three NFRs. Various model-driven engineering (MDE) approaches and technologies, including simulation modeling platform (SMP), unified modeling language (UML), domain specific modeling (DSM), eclipse modeling framework (EMF), graphical modeling framework (GMF), and so forth, are applied where possible in representing the CSES model architecture and its components' behaviors from physical and cognitive domain aspects. A prototype CSES system, called weapon effectiveness simulation system (WESS), and a non-trivial air-combat simulation example are presented to demonstrate the methodology.},

  pages={322-337},
  abstract={Context: Gamification appears to improve enjoyment and quality of execution of software engineering activities, including software testing. Though commonly employed in industry, manual exploratory testing of web application GUIs was proven to be mundane and expensive. Gamification applied to that kind of testing activity has the potential to overcome its limitations, though no empirical research has explored this area yet. Goal: Collect preliminary insights on how gamification, when performed by novice testers, affects the effectiveness, efficiency, test case realism, and user experience in exploratory testing of web applications. Method: Common gamification features augment an existing exploratory testing tool: Final Score with Leaderboard, Injected Bugs, Progress Bar, and Exploration Highlights. The original tool and the gamified version are then compared in an experiment involving 144 participants. User experience is elicited using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire instrument. Results: Statistical analysis identified several significant differences for metrics that represent the effectiveness and efficiency of tests showing an improvement in coverage when they were developed with gamification. Additionally, user experience is improved with gamification. Conclusions: Gamification of exploratory testing has a tangible effect on how testers create test cases for web applications. While the results are mixed, the effects are most beneficial and interesting and warrant more research in the future. Further research shall be aimed at confirming the presented results in the context of state-of-the-art testing tools and real-world development environments.},

  abstract={Parallel discrete event simulation frameworks have been widely used to analyze the performance of traditional applications under different scenarios. The existing frameworks are designed to work on a cluster and cloud-based computing environments. With the current advances in the Internet of Things, there is a strong need to revamp such traditional frameworks and make use of the smart connected-devices as an underlying infrastructure to perform simulations. In this article, we propose a new simulation framework, which has been specifically designed to work with diverse heterogeneous devices. The framework allows these heterogeneous mobile devices to participate in a distributed simulation while managing network latency, using device profiles that are maintained by the simulation framework. Moreover, in the proposed framework, random and context-aware simulation task distributions have been explored to manage the devices’ sporadic connectivity. Evaluation results using the well-known PHOLD benchmark demonstrate a gain in the overall efficiency of the proposed simulation system.},

  year={1999},
  volume={11},
  number={6},
  pages={657-671},
  abstract={In two ERP experiments we investigated how and when the language comprehension system relates an incoming word to semantic representations of an unfolding local sentence and a wider discourse. In Experiment 1, subjects were presented with short stories. The last sentence of these stories occasionally contained a critical word that, although acceptable in the local sentence context, was semantically anomalous with respect to the wider discourse (e.g., Jane told the brother that he was exceptionally slow in a discourse context where he had in fact been very quick). Relative to coherent control words (e.g., quick), these discourse-dependent semantic anomalies elicited a large N400 effect that began at about 200 to 250 msec after word onset. In Experiment 2, the same sentences were presented without their original story context. Although the words that had previously been anomalous in discourse still elicited a slightly larger average N400 than the coherent words, the resulting N400 effect was much reduced, showing that the large effect observed in stories depended on the wider discourse. In the same experiment, single sentences that contained a clear local semantic anomaly elicited a standard sentence-dependent N400 effect (e.g., Kutas & Hillyard, 1980). The N400 effects elicited in discourse and in single sentences had the same time course, overall morphology, and scalp distribution. We argue that these findings are most compatible with models of language processing in which there is no fundamental distinction between the integration of a word in its local (sentence-level) and its global (discourse-level) semantic context.},

  abstract={This paper presents the design process of an equivalent circuit simulation (ECS) method and its analysis results to evaluate the delayed response time and thermal stability behavior of no-insulation (NI) second-generation high-temperature superconducting (2G HTS) coils. The electrical and thermal characteristics of NI HTS coil were introduced by many researchers through the simulation method base on ECS model, but the feature of heat generation by superconducting and stabilizer layer was not considered in the previous studies. In this study, we analyze the electrical and thermal characteristics considering heat generation of NI HTS coil in both steady and transient states. First, an electrical ECS model was proposed to numerically analyze the characteristics of the NI 2G HTS coil in steady and transient states. A steady-state simulation was performed under rated operating-current shooting to estimate the magnetic-field response performance of the NI HTS coil. The transient-state simulation was performed under an overcurrent shooting to analyze the thermal quench behavior. In addition, the simulation results of the NI HTS coil were discussed and compared with the experimental ones to validate the simulation approach based on the proposed equivalent electric-circuit model.},

  year={2016},
  volume={59},
  number={2},
  pages={140-152},
  abstract={Teaching problem: Immersive pedagogies—including real-world or client-based projects, case studies, and simulations—have long been used to encourage student problem-solving, analytical thinking, and teamwork in professional communication. Building a connection to the real world has real challenges, however, for both instructors and students. How can we better prepare students for their future careers in our technical communication courses? Situating the case: This paper draws on three areas in the literature to situate the Arisoph case study: First, we discuss the work that has been done with client-based projects and the problems and challenges researchers have found with incorporating these projects into the classroom. Second, we discuss a newer model of workplace simulations, particularly focusing on the work done by Fisher and Russell. Third, we discuss the psychological theories of attribution and reattribution, which provided a foundation for our development of the Arisoph case study. How this case was studied: This paper describes the development of the Arisoph case study, an online client-based simulation course designed for engineering students to learn and practice technical communication. Course development and collection of instructor and student responses took place from 2010 to 2014. About the case: This paper details the development and implementation of the Arisoph case study, which brought the workplace realities of a variety of engineering professions into a classroom filled with engineering majors. The Arisoph simulation was designed to manage student attribution and reattribution, particularly to help engineering students connect the principles and skills learned in technical communication courses with their future careers. The Arisoph case study is a full-semester simulation, where students apply for work in a fictional company and fulfill different roles on professional teams. Each assignment during the semester is situated in the context of the simulation. The major projects for the simulation, however, come from a real client in the engineering field. This unique combination of simulation and client-based projects provides students with greater opportunities for successful reattribution. Conclusions: Initial student reactions to the course show an increased understanding of workplace communication and a greater motivation to produce the best possible product for the client. We hope that long-term studies will show significant carryover of those attitudes into students' careers.},

  volume={41},

  pages={420-425},
  abstract={The PEGASUS facility houses one of the railguns of the French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis (ISL). With its 10 MJ distributed energy storage and a 6-m-long launcher tube, projectiles with a mass of several hundred grams are accelerated to muzzle velocities greater than 2000 m/s. The fiber brush armatures are supported by a sabot made of glass-fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP), an orthotropic insulating material with the best mechanical performance found so far. If the muzzle velocity is intended to be substantially increased, the sabot material may reach its mechanical limits due to the high dynamic loading. Hence, a precise understanding of the material behavior will be necessary, especially with regard to the failure mechanisms that occur. The mechanical behavior of the sabot is analyzed by means of numerical simulation combining two three-dimensional (3-D) finite-element codes: the electromagnetic code MEGA and the mechanical dynamic code LS-DYNA3D. The Lorentz force computed by MEGA is introduced into LS-DYNA3D as a time- and space-dependent volumetric load inside the brushes. By calculating the stress-strain distribution of the sabot, the regions which are liable to fail can be identified. The simulation results are validated by comparison with the experimental work using the X-ray photographs taken at the muzzle of the launcher.},

  abstract={This article aims to provide a systematic review of existing research on the use of digital game-based learning (DGBL) technology for foreign language (English) in preschool and elementary schools. Digital game-based technology enables learning to become more interactive and inspirational, thereby enhancing language acquisition. The authors present a DGBL classification schema with four main components, design principles, language content, pedagogical factors, and feedback mechanisms, as guidelines for designing and implementing DGBL in foreign language learning. This survey classifies and filters 110 published articles from January 2010 to April 2022 based on the proposed DGBL schema adhering to the insertion and omission criteria, from which 50 studies focus on preschool and primary school students between the ages of 2 and 10 years. The findings indicate that DGBL influences motivation, creativity, and problem-solving ability. However, the synthesized literature also reveals challenges and issues in designing and developing DGBL systems based on novel technologies. The findings are fundamental for exploring the game classification schema for designing and implementing game-based learning to augment the trends of DBGL in foreign language learning and identify the possible issues and solutions for DGBL to lessen health concerns and technology challenges. The authors recommend emerging technologies and software engineering processes as possible solutions for continuity in DGBL research by enlightening the significance of evolving technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, deep learning, AR/VR, and development and operations.},

  title={AI-Driven Driver Behavior Assessment Through Vehicle and Health Monitoring for Safe Driving—A Survey}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={12},
  number={},
  pages={48044-48056},
  abstract={Safe driving is a serious and challenging concern that is dependent on driver behaviors including aggressive, distracted, fatigued, and drowsy driving. In a smart society, in-vehicle monitoring of drivers and detecting abnormal driving behavior as anomalies can reduce the rate of road crashes. Existing surveys cover the various schemes for detecting on-road driver behaviors through sensing data. We have identified a gap in the linkage of driver’s health or vehicle conditions to abnormal behaviors that are not yet covered. This work presents a taxonomy of schemes, and the analytical evaluation and identifies the open research challenges. The work specifically investigates the modeling of driver behavior and the detection of abnormal behavior, utilizing techniques such as AI-based image processing, signal processing, and traditional algorithmic approaches. This analysis encompasses methods and features based on both driver health and vehicle monitoring with the ultimate goal of ensuring safe driving. More specifically, existing approaches are classified in a coherent taxonomy by reviewing traditional mathematical, machine learning, and deep learning-based schemes. Moreover, a summary of schemes is presented to highlight the key points followed by a comprehensive analytical discussion. It aids in pinpointing research issues by leveraging the insights gained from the comparison. Finally, the work highlights the open research challenges for the researchers to provide innovative solutions.},

  pages={256-268},
  abstract={The level of presence is likely to influence the effect of media violence. This project examines the causes and consequences of presence in the context of violent video game play. In a between subjects design, 227 participants were randomly assigned to play either a violent or a nonviolent video game. The results are consistent with what would be predicted by social learning theory and are consistent with previous presence research. Causal modeling analyses reveal two separate paths to presence: from individual differences and condition. The first path reveals that individual differences (previous game use and gender) predict presence. Those who frequently play video games reported higher levels of presence than those who play video games less frequently. Males play more games but felt less presence than women. The second path is related to perceived violence: those who perceived the game to be more violent felt more presence than those who perceived less violence in the game. Both of these paths were influenced by frustration with the game, which reduced presence. Those who felt more presence felt more hostility and were more verbally aggressive than those who felt lower levels of presence. Higher levels of presence led to increased physically aggressive intentions. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

  title={A Formal Approach for Modeling and Simulation of Human Car-Following Behavior}, 
  year={2018},
  volume={19},
  number={2},
  pages={639-648},
  abstract={Car-following is the activity of safely driving behind a leading vehicle. Traditional mathematical car-following models capture vehicle dynamics without considering human factors, such as driver distraction and the reaction delay. Consequently, the resultant model produces overly safe driving traces during simulation, which are unrealistic. Some recent work incorporate simplistic human factors, though model validation using experimental data is lacking. In this paper, we incorporate three distinct human factors in new compositional car-following model called modal car-following model, which is based on hybrid input output automata (HIOA). HIOA have been widely used for the specification and verification of cyber-physical systems. HIOA incorporate the modeling of the physical system combined with discrete mode switches, which is ideal for describing piece-wise continuous phenomena. Thus, HIOA models offer a succinct framework for the specification of car-following behavior. The human factors considered in our approach are estimation error (due to imperfect distance perception), reaction delay, and temporal anticipation. Two widely used car-following models called Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) and Full Velocity Difference Model (FVDM) are used for extension and comparison purpose. We evaluate the root mean square (rms) error of the following vehicle position using the traces obtained from human drives through different driving scenarios. The result shows that our model reduces the rms error in IDM and FVDM by up to 48.8% and 7.41%, respectively.},

  pages={733-741},
  abstract={A noisy behavior of the time-domain passivity controller during the period of low velocity is analyzed. Main reasons of the noisy behavior are investigated through a simulation with a one-DOF haptic interface model. It is shown that the PO/PC is ineffective in dissipating the produced energy when the sign of the velocity, which is numerically calculated from the measured position, is suddenly changed, and when this velocity is zero. These cases happen during the period of low velocity due to the limited resolution of the position sensor. New methods, ignoring the produced energy from the velocity sign change, and holding the control force while the velocity is zero, are proposed for removing the noisy behavior. The feasibility of the developed methods is proved with both a simulation and a real experiment.},

  abstract={Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are increasingly recognized as the key to the power industry’s shift towards decentralization, carbon neutrality, and electrification because of their potential as flexible assets. Advances in grid integration, communication standards, smart charging, vehicle-to-grid technology, and electric vehicle service platforms are crucial for effectively leveraging BEVs. However, realizing these potential hinges on the active participation of electric vehicle owners, which is a vital yet challenging aspect. This study proposes a gamification-based incentive model to boost the participation of BEV owners in demand response programs, focusing on enhancing grid flexibility. A pilot project involving BEV drivers and charging-point operators was conducted on Jeju Island, South Korea. The significant contributions of this study include the development of both hardware and software systems for the gamification model and an ANOVA analysis to assess its impact. Compared with conventional economic incentives, the application of gamification-based incentives had effects of 13.8–69.2 percent from a demand increase perspective and 2.0–91.4 percent from a demand reduction perspective.},

An online survey was conducted with 534 players of Summoners War. The overall results show that the PI of PTI is associated with both rational and impulsive factors. Specifically, the results of hierarchical regression analysis demonstrate that along with two TPB elements (attitude and perceived control), individual factors of self-control and general stress, as well as game-related factors of advancement, competition, purchase frequency and spending amount were all significant predictors of PTI PI. These non-volitional factors account for additional 18% of variance out of 48% total variance (R2 = .48) in PI.},

  title={Layered Behavior Modeling via Combining Descriptive and Prescriptive Approaches: A Case Study of Infantry Company Engagement}, 
  year={2020},
  volume={50},
  number={7},
  pages={2551-2565},
  abstract={Defense modeling and simulation (DM&S) has brought insights into how to efficiently operate combat entities, such as soldiers and weapon systems. Most DM&S works have been developed to reflect accurate descriptions of military doctrines, yet these doctrines provide only guidelines of military operations, not details about how the combat entities should behave. Because such vague parts are often fulfilled with the appropriate behavior of combat entities in a battlefield, one part argues that DM&S should consider individual combat behaviors as well. However, it is known as an infeasible problem discovering best individual actions from infinite searching space, such as the battlefield. This paper proposes a layered behavior modeling to practically resolve this issue. The proposed method applies descriptive modeling to reduce the searching space by employing domain-specific knowledge; and prescriptive modeling to discover best individual actions in the reduced space. For the generalization, the proposed method adapts both modeling methods being modularized, and then the proposed method suggested an interface between them that is based on their semantic analogies. Both modeling methods are modularized, so they are interacted through an interface defined in the proposed method. This paper presents a realization of the proposed method through a case study of infantry company-level operations. In the case study, the proposed method is implemented with discrete event system specification formalism as the descriptive part and Markov decision process as the prescriptive part. The experimental results illustrated that the combat effectiveness resulted from the proposed method is statistically better than that from the descriptive-only modeling, and the difference would be guided by the objective of the combat behavior. Through the presented experimental results and the discussion, this paper argues that future DM&S should consider a broad spectrum from the battlefield incorporating the rational behavior of military individuals.},

  year={2022},
  volume={14},
  number={4},
  pages={696-705},
  abstract={Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) provides reliable results for determining cognitive load based on averaged cortical blood flow during multiple repetitions of short cognitive tasks. At the same time, it remains unclear how to use this technique for assessing cognitive load during prolonged single-trial activity. In this study, we used a computer-based emergency simulation game for inducing different levels of cognitive load. We propose a novel approach to measure cognitive load using specific time slots, determined based on simulation log-data interpreted in light of Barrouillet's time-based resource-sharing model. To validate this approach, we compared cortical activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) regions measured at four specific time slots during a simulation. We found significant associations between cognitive load and neuronal activity within the DLPFC depending on the chosen time slot, whereas no such dependencies were found for the IFG. These results illustrate how knowledge of task structure could be used advantageously for the identification of cognitive load. Although requiring further investigation in terms of reliability and generalizability, the presented approach can be considered promising evidence that fNIRS might be suitable for more general reliable assessments of cognitive load during prolonged single-trial activities and for real-time adaptations in simulation-based learning environments.},

  pages={1172-1187},
  abstract={Multiplatooning leaders positioning and cooperative behavior strategies are proposed in this paper, to improve the efficiency of a traffic system of communicant automated vehicles evolving on dedicated lanes. Novel algorithms to ensure high traffic capacity are presented and MATLAB/Simulink-based simulation results are reported. In previous research work, we proposed new algorithms to mitigate communication delays effects on platoon string stability using anticipatory information. In this paper we consider constant spacing between platoons' leaders as a fundamental condition to attain high traffic capacity. New algorithms to maintain interplatoon leaders' constant spacing are proposed, as well as novel algorithms allowing vehicles to enter the main track cooperatively. Furthermore, a new set of algorithms to improve safety is also presented. A novel agent-based architecture was developed, in which each vehicle consists of two distinct modules, a leader and a follower. Based on MATLAB/Simulink simulations of several scenarios, the new algorithms are assessed and the simulation results presented, confirming that the proposed algorithms ensure high traffic capacity and vehicle density and avoid traffic congestion. These features were validated through simulations performed on the Simulation for Urban Mobility simulation platform, using a new car-following model implementation [10]. The results proved that the proposed algorithms enable a clear benefit of a platooning system, when compared with bus- and light-rail-based transit systems.},

  abstract={This paper focuses on the numerical research of the influence of polymer (polyoxymethylene) on the arc behavior during arc-motion process. The mathematical model of 3-D air-arc plasma considering the ablation of sidewalls is built based on magnetic hydrodynamics. The mass-fraction equation is introduced to the model on the basis of traditional mass, momentum, and energy-balance equations. The influence of wall ablation on the thermodynamic and transport properties of air-polymer mixtures is considered in this paper. The distributions of temperature field, pressure field, and mass fraction in the arc chamber are calculated. The simulation results indicate that the vapor concentration behind the arc column is higher than that in front of the arc column because of the existence of ldquovortexrdquo in the arc chamber. The use of polymers could accelerate arc movement and reduce the probability of occurrence of back-striking. Using polymers can also increase arc voltage, which can be explained by the change of electrical conductivity for air-polymer vapor mixtures.},

High (ph) value of SF6 gas at a temperature of 2000 K plays an important role for the peculiar behaviors of the SF6 arcs. The simulation by the cylindrical arc model[1] shows that the temperature profile across the arc is steep in the current decreasing phase and becomes broad in the current increasing phase. The time evolution of the current and voltage of the SF6 gas arc is interpreted into a curve on a (1/R) (dR/dt)-(ei) plane. The simulation results by the cylindrical arc model are plotted on the (l/R)(dR/dt)-(ei) plane to compare them with the experimental results. The cylindrical arc model gives a better similarity to the actual arc than Mayr's model in the current decreasing phase.},

  abstract={The introduction and popularity of the Nintendo Wii home console has brought attention to the natural mapping motion capturing controller. Using a sample that identified sports as their most frequently played video games, a mental models approach was used to test the impact that perceived controller naturalness (traditional controller vs. natural mapping motion capturing controller) had on perceptions of spatial presence, realism, and enjoyment. The results showed that perceived video game realism is a predictor of spatial presence and enjoyment. Furthermore, the results supported predictions that controller naturalness would influence perceived video game realism of graphics and sound. Future research should investigate whether or not these controllers lead to greater presence and enjoyment in different genres of games (e.g., first-person shooters). In addition, future research should consider whether or not these controllers have the ability to prime violent mental models.},

  year={2003},
  volume={12},
  number={3},
  pages={311-325},
  abstract={The development of computer-generated synthetic environments, also calleddistributed virtual environments, for military simulation relies heavily upon computer-generated actors (CGAs) to provide accurate behaviors at reasonable cost so that the synthetic environments are useful, affordable, complex, and realistic. Unfortunately, the pace of synthetic environment development and the level of desired CGA performance continue to rise at a much faster rate than CGA capability improvements. This insatiable demand for realism in CGAs for synthetic environments arises from the growing understanding of the significant role that modeling and simulation can play in a variety of venues. These uses include training, analysis, procurement decisions, mission rehearsal, doctrine development, force-level and task-level training, information assurance, cyberwarfare, force structure analysis, sustainability analysis, life cycle costs analysis, material management, infrastructure analysis, and many others. In these and other uses of military synthetic environments, computer-generated actors play a central role because they have the potential to increase the realism of the environment while also reducing the cost of operating the environment. The progress made in addressing the technical challenges that must be overcome to realize effective and realistic CGAs for military simulation environments and the technical areas that should be the focus of future work are the subject of this series of papers, which survey the technologies and progress made in the construction and use of CGAs. In this, the first installment in the series of three papers, we introduce the topic of computer-generated actors and issues related to their performance and fidelity and other background information for this research area as related to military simulation. We also discuss CGA reasoning system techniques and architectures.},

  pages={1648-1652},
  abstract={In this study, the resistive switching (RS) and different synaptic behaviors have been observed by controlling the different applied bias voltages in the p+-Si/n-ZnO heterojunction memristor. After a big forming voltage, the formation and rupture of the oxygen vacancy filaments model has been proposed, and different migration amount of oxygen ions realizes the multiple RS behaviors. Prior to the electroforming, different synaptic behaviors have been observed dependent on the applied bias voltage based on the oxygen ion migration processes. Under small bias (<2.5 V), the oxygen ion of ZnO film first migrates and inters into p/n-junction barrier region, leading to the increasing barrier height/width. With increasing voltage, the electric field will further induce oxygen ion migration and entrance to Si film, leading to the decreasing barrier height/width. Several synaptic functions are demonstrated, such as nonlinear transmission characteristics, long-term memory (LTM)/short-term memory (STM) and “learning-experience” behavior. Multifunction memristive behaviors and these mechanisms research are important to design and realize the multifunction devices for decreasing the manufacturing complexity.},

  year={2023},
  volume={15},
  number={3},
  pages={450-459},
  abstract={With mobile gaming becoming ever more popular, it is necessary to understand various aspects of player behavior in those games. This is especially true for free-to-play games as revenue comes from a small subset of the playerbase. This article presents a large-scale analysis of data collected over 9 months, comprising over 10 million players of a case study free-to-play mobile interactive story telling video game. The data are analyzed from a temporal standpoint, followed by presentation of findings in three important player engagement aspects: 1) retention; 2) conversion (i.e., players becoming payers); 3) lifetime revenue collected. These findings confirm the importance of early conversion in casual mobile games as the retention is low due to wide target audience. Additionally, players who convert very early also tend to spend more in the game in general. Most of the monetization depends on a small fraction of large spenders as one fifth of the entire revenue comes from only 2% of spenders.

  abstract={Agent based systems are increasingly being applied in a wide range of areas including telecommunications, business process modeling, computer games, control of mobile robots, and military simulations. Such systems are typically extremely complex and it is often useful to be able to simulate an agent based system to learn more about its behavior or investigate the implications of alternative architectures. The authors discuss the application of distributed discrete event simulation techniques to the simulation of multiagent systems. We identify the efficient distribution of the agents' environment as a key problem in the simulation of agent based systems and present an approach to the decomposition of the environment that facilitates load balancing.},

  abstract={In today's highly dynamic and competitive environment, companies are under the pressure to improve their supply chain strategy in order to be more responsive to customer demand. However, supply chains are susceptible to unanticipated events that make responsive supply chain management a challenging task. One such disruption event is a product stockout at the retailer. In this paper, we investigate retail stockouts through the development of an agent-based simulation model in order to develop a better understanding of the effect of different stockout lengths for different products (with different consumer response profiles to stockouts) on both the retailer and the manufacturer of the product. We consider the change of market share as a measure of resilience for both the manufacturer and the retailer to examine the impact of the stockout. Insights are developed for manufacturers and retailers in responding to the stockout disruption.},

  abstract={Since millions suffer from major depressive and bipolar disorders, the modeling, characterization, classification, and diagnostic analysis of such mental disorders bear great significance in medical and pharmaceutical research. YinYang bipolar sets are introduced for neurobiological modeling and diagnostic analysis of such disorders. It is shown that bipolar sets and a bipolar dynamic modus ponens (BDMP) build a technological bridge from a linear, static, and closed world to a nonlinear, dynamic, and open world of equilibria, quasi-equilibria, or nonequilibria and provide a novel model for bipolar neurobiological diagnostic analysis with added rigor to the current standard. It is shown that bipolar inference can help in understanding both the classic manifestations and the counterintuitive symptoms of bipolar disorders with applications in clinical psychopharmacology. Mathematical and visual characterizations of core features of such disorders are presented. A unified diagnosis and outcome model of different treatments are presented for different types of bipolar disorders. The significance and novelty of this work is twofold: 1) it introduces YinYang into biomedicine for the understanding of certain neurobiological disorders and fosters a new standard model for clinical, therapeutic, and pharmacological research and applications; 2) it presents a mathematical basis for the characterization of mood regulation in individuals and/or a cohort of patients with applications in biomedical engineering and potential applications in nanotechnologies for integrated care of major depressive and bipolar disorders.},

  title={Analyzing Medical Guideline Dissemination Behaviors Using Culturally Infused Agent Based Modeling Framework}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={25},
  number={6},
  pages={2137-2149},
  abstract={Clinical practice guidelines are a critical medium for the standardization of practices within the overall medical community. However, several studies have shown that, in general, there is a significant delay in the adoption of recommendations in such guidelines. Surveys have identified multiple barriers, including clinical inertia, organizational culture/incentives, access to information and peer influence on guideline dissemination and adoption. Although modeling techniques, especially agent-based models, have shown promise, a rigorous computational model for guideline dissemination that incorporates the intricacies of medical decision making and interactions of healthcare workers, and can identify more effective dissemination strategies, is needed. Similar modeling and simulation issues are also prevalent in many other domains such as opinion diffusion, innovation, and technology adoption. In this paper, we introduce a novel overarching computational modeling and simulation framework called the Culturally Infused Agent Based Modeling (CI-ABM) Framework. CI-ABM is a generalizable framework that provides the capability to model a wide range of real-world complex scenarios. To validate the framework, we focus on modeling and analyzing the dissemination of a Type 2 diabetes guideline that recommends individualizing glycemic (A1C) goals. Using existing cross-sectional surveys from physicians across the US, we demonstrate how our methodology for incorporating various socio-cultural and other related factors in agent based models lead to better posterior probability-based analysis and prediction of guideline dissemination behaviors.},

  year={2005},
  volume={17},
  number={7},
  pages={1602-1645},
  abstract={In neuroimaging studies of human cognitive abilities, brain activation patterns that include regions that are strongly interactive in response to experimental task demands are of particular interest. Among the existing network analyses, partial least squares (PLS; McIntosh, 1999; McIntosh, Bookstein, Haxby, & Grady, 1996) has been highly successful, particu-larly in identifying group differences in regional functional connectivity, including differences as diverse as those associated with states of aware-ness and normal aging. However, we address the need for a within-group model that identifies patterns of regional functional connectivity that ex-hibit sustained activity across graduated changes in task parameters. For example, predictions of sustained connectivity are commonplace in stud-ies of cognition that involve a series of tasks over which task difficulty increases (Baddeley, 2003). We designed ordinal trend analysis (OrT) to identify activation patterns that increase monotonically in their expres-sion as the experimental task parameter increases, while the correlative relationships between brain regions remain constant. Of specific interest are patterns that express positive ordinal trends on a subject-by-subject basis. A unique feature of OrT is that it recovers information about func-tional connectivity based solely on experimental design variables. In par-ticular, there is no requirement by OrT to provide either a quantitative model of the uncertain relationship between functional brain circuitry and subject variables (e.g., task performance and IQ) or partial informa-tion about the regions that are functionally connected. In this letter, we provide a step-by-step recipe of the computations performed in the new OrT analysis, including a description of the inferential statistical meth-ods applied. Second, we describe applications of OrT to an event-related fMRI study of verbal working memory and H2 15 O-PET study of visuo-motor learning. In sum, OrT has potential applications to not only studies of young adults and their cognitive abilities, but also studies of normal aging and neurological and psychiatric disease.},

  pages={1077-1091},
  abstract={Building information modeling is only beginning to incorporate human factors, although buildings are sites where humans and technologies interact with globally significant consequences. Some buildings fail to perform as their designers intended, in part because users do not or cannot properly operate the building, and some occupants behave differently than designers expect. Innovative buildings, e.g., green buildings, are particularly susceptible to usability problems. This paper presents a framework for prospectively measuring the usability of designs before buildings are constructed, while there is still time to improve the design. The framework, which was implemented as an agent-based computer simulation model, tests how well buildings are likely to perform, given realistic occupants. An illustrative model for lighting design shows that this modeling approach has practical efficacy, demonstrating that, to the extent that users exhibit heterogeneous behaviors and preferences, designs that allow greater local control and ease of operation perform better.},

  abstract={The device-level description of power switches is an emerging topic that enhances the real-time simulation (RTS) accuracy of power electronic converters. However, device-level RTS (DLRTS) is challenging due to contradictions between the additional computing amounts introduced by nonlinear switch models and the nanosecond-level simulation time step required by fast switching transients. Therefore, much research has sought the tradeoff between the accuracy and speed in DLRTSs. In this article, we review state-of-the-art DLRTS technologies, in particular for device-level switch models and efficient network solvers. Moreover, we summarize different applications of DLRTSs and crosswise compare their performances. We also give some outlooks on future research. This review not only provides a comprehensive overview of DLRTSs for general audiences but also provides a technical reference for practitioners.

  abstract={This paper presents a multiphysics simulation and layout design technique for complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor-microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) (CMOS-MEMS) based on an electrical circuit simulator. An equivalent circuit model for the mechanical equation of motion has been translated into a Verilog-A-compatible hardware description language (HDL) in the Cadence Virtuoso environment to attain new designing capabilities such as automatic mask-layout synthesis, design rule check, and layout-versus-schematic verification for MEMS structures. Microelectromechanical components such as parallel-plate actuator and bending suspension, whose analytical equation models are already known, are also interpreted into HDL-coded equivalent circuits. Behavior of a MEMS device, including the electrostatic displacement hysteresis and the negative spring constant effect, is numerically simulated as a lumped mass-and-spring system, which has been verified to quantitatively agree with that of the corresponding analytical simulation results. A multiphysics model for the Colpitts oscillator circuit has been built in the developed simulation environment by replacing a quartz resonator with a compact model of an electrostatic silicon resonator, and its self-excited resonance has been confirmed by the simulation after the coordination of the device and circuit parameters. A prototype conversion tool for MEMS parameterized cell has also been developed to demonstrate automatic generation of mask layouts for a silicon resonator, which has been cross-checked against the experimental measurements to verify the simulation accuracy.},

  abstract={Intelligent agents working in real-time domains need to adapt to changing circumstance so that they can improve their performance and avoid their mistakes. AI agents designed for interactive games, however, typically lack this ability. Game agents are traditionally implemented using static, hand-authored behaviors or scripts that are brittle to changing world dynamics and cause a break in player experience when they repeatedly fail. Furthermore, their static nature causes a lot of effort for the game designers as they have to think of all imaginable circumstances that can be encountered by the agent. The problem is exacerbated as state-of-the-art computer games have huge decision spaces, interactive users, and real-time performance that make the problem of creating AI approaches for these domains harder. In this paper, we address the issue of nonadaptivity of game playing agents in complex real-time domains. The agents carry out runtime adaptation of their behavior sets by monitoring and reasoning about their behavior execution to dynamically carry out revisions on the behaviors. The behavior adaptation approaches have been instantiated in two real-time interactive game domains. The evaluation results show that the agents in the two domains successfully adapt themselves by revising their behavior sets appropriately.},

  abstract={We present a theoretical study using Monte-Carlo simulation of the behavior of a CMOS inverter struck by an ionizing particle. The inverter is made of two complementary enhancement-mode MOSFETs according to a SIMOX self-aligned technology with an effective gate length of 0.35 /spl mu/m. The effect of the ionizing particle (heavy ion) is simulated by electron-hole pairs generation with an energy of 1 eV for each carrier. We studied the return to the steady-state of the device after a transient irradiation. Either the P-channel transistor or the N-channel transistor is irradiated, and the gate operating is considered in both cases of 0 V and 5 V input voltage. The irradiation of the off-state transistors induces a significant transient variation of the output voltage whereas irradiation of the on-state transistors has weak effects on the output. The return to the stationary regime, which is reached after about 50 ps in all irradiation cases, is achieved by evacuation of the carriers in excess through the different electrodes without trapping effect in the device.<>},

  year={2024},
  volume={30},
  number={7},
  pages={3871-3883},
  abstract={Gaze behavior of virtual characters in video games and virtual reality experiences is a key factor of realism and immersion. Indeed, gaze plays many roles when interacting with the environment; not only does it indicate what characters are looking at, but it also plays an important role in verbal and non-verbal behaviors and in making virtual characters alive. Automated computing of gaze behaviors is however a challenging problem, and to date none of the existing methods are capable of producing close-to-real results in an interactive context. We therefore propose a novel method that leverages recent advances in several distinct areas related to visual saliency, attention mechanisms, saccadic behavior modelling, and head-gaze animation techniques. Our approach articulates these advances to converge on a multi-map saliency-driven model which offers real-time realistic gaze behaviors for non-conversational characters, together with additional user-control over customizable features to compose a wide variety of results. We first evaluate the benefits of our approach through an objective evaluation that confronts our gaze simulation with ground truth data using an eye-tracking dataset specifically acquired for this purpose. We then rely on subjective evaluation to measure the level of realism of gaze animations generated by our method, in comparison with gaze animations captured from real actors. Our results show that our method generates gaze behaviors that cannot be distinguished from captured gaze animations. Overall, we believe that these results will open the way for more natural and intuitive design of realistic and coherent gaze animations for real-time applications.},

  abstract={Android is the most popular mobile platform, and it has become a primary malware target. Existing behavior-based Android malware detection methods suffer from false positive and false negative problems, which lead to low detection accuracy. Formal theory is crucial in studying the behaviors of Android applications characterized by high concurrency, interaction, and mobility. However, existing formal methods mainly focus on specific issues and lack the essential abstraction and high-level description of application behavior. In this study, we propose a formal method for the description and decision of application behavior based on process algebra. First, we propose a formal method for describing application behavior at a component level using process algebra. By extending  $\pi $ -calculus theory, we establish the mapping relationship from the Android application to process algebra, and present the semantics and evolution rules of behavior based on process algebra. Second, we describe the behavior of four types of components in applications and characterize concurrent interactions of components using process algebra expressions. Third, we define the behavior equivalence and simulation mechanism for application behavior analysis and propose the decision rules based on weak simulation. Finally, we discuss a demonstration case, which includes malicious behavior, to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that our method can accurately describe and analyze application behavior, which provides theoretical support for technologies and methods of behavior-based detection.},

This paper conducts a thorough narrative literature review on neuromarketing, analyzing the application of diverse neuroscientific techniques, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), positron emission tomography (PET), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and facial coding/eye tracking, to assess cerebral responses and forecast consumer behavior. Recent scholarly investigations underscore how neuromarketing utilizes contemporary breakthroughs to transform consumer behavior research by offering enhanced insights into cognition and emotion. These sophisticated tools have contested conventional study methodologies, facilitating a more comprehensive comprehension of the interaction between marketing stimuli and the brain. The theoretical and practical aspects of the findings are that advanced neuroimaging techniques like fMRI, EEG, and eye-tracking have revealed the complex interactions between emotions, attention, and memory that traditional methods and neuromarketing transform marketing by giving marketers new tools and approaches to boost results. This review synthesizes previous research on the topic, highlighting the necessity for equilibrium between scientific advancement and ethical accountability in neuromarketing, thereby benefiting both academic and commercial sectors.},

However, dynamic environmental factors introduce stochastic and nonlinear behaviors in PES, challenging controller design. This article presents an FPGA-based real-time X-in-the-loop (XIL) simulation testbench that accounts for environmental factors. Specifically, a stochastic analysis model, along with a hybrid implicit/explicit (IMEX) solver is developed to assess the introduced nonlinearity and stochasticity. The advantages of the XIL testbench are underscored through a case study featuring a 350-kW wireless charging system including 28 switches. The XIL testbench attains about 1/4 step size utilizing merely half the computational resources on the same FPGA compared to commercial testbenches, while further supporting stochastic and nonlinear simulations. Comparisons with offline software and commercial testbench validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed testbench in handling stochastic and nonlinear behaviors, offering a viable solution for efficiently testing controllers in dynamic environments.},

  abstract={Surgical simulation is a graphical application that requires real-time interaction with deformable 3D objects. A surgical training system must allow the trainee to interact with virtual soft tissue. Therefore, the challenging task is to develop efficient models of living tissues so that the realistic simulation of tool-tissue interaction can be performed in real time. To graphically model and animate the realistic behavior of deformable tissue in surgical simulations, the authors' system adapts tetrahedra resolution by dynamically retessellating the mesh in and around the regions of interest. This technique overcomes limitations of previous methods that made it difficult to modify the mesh's topology online},

  abstract={RF noise immunity is becoming a serious problem for integrated circuits (ICs). We have found a frequency-domain simulator [harmonic balance (HB)] to be useful for analyzing the undesired IC behavior, especially the DC output shift under the large RF injection. The simulator has the following advantages in comparison with a conventional time-domain simulator such as SPICE: (1) DC output shifts can be simulated in a very short time using a conventional bipolar transistor model and (2) steady-state current or voltage waveforms at each node in an IC are directly and easily obtained. This paper describes the methods and results of the DC shifts analysis of a bipolar transistor or a differential amplifier using the HB simulator.},

  number={10},
  pages={2080-2085},
  abstract={Objective: The overall goal of this paper is to demonstrate that dissemination of models and analyses for assessing the reproducibility of simulation results can be incorporated in the scientific review process in biomechanics. Methods: As part of a special issue on model sharing and reproducibility in the IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, two manuscripts on computational biomechanics were submitted: Rajagopal et al., IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng., 2016 and Schmitz and Piovesan, IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng., 2016. Models used in these studies were shared with the scientific reviewers and the public. In addition to the standard review of the manuscripts, the reviewers downloaded the models and performed simulations that reproduced results reported in the studies. Results: There was general agreement between simulation results of the authors and those of the reviewers. Discrepancies were resolved during the necessary revisions. The manuscripts and instructions for download and simulation were updated in response to the reviewers' feedback; changes that may otherwise have been missed if explicit model sharing and simulation reproducibility analysis was not conducted in the review process. Increased burden on the authors and the reviewers, to facilitate model sharing and to repeat simulations, were noted. Conclusion: When the authors of computational biomechanics studies provide access to models and data, the scientific reviewers can download and thoroughly explore the model, perform simulations, and evaluate simulation reproducibility beyond the traditional manuscript-only review process.  Significance: Model sharing and reproducibility analysis in scholarly publishing will result in a more rigorous review process, which will enhance the quality of modeling and simulation studies and inform future users of computational models.},

  abstract={Many computer games use custom scripts to control the ambient behaviors of nonplayer characters. As a result, story authors must write computer code for the game world's hundreds or thousands of NPCs. Creating entertaining, nonrepetitive NPC behaviors without investing substantial programming effort to write customized, nontrivial scripts is challenging. Current computer games have simplistic ambient behaviors for NPCs; it's rare for such characters to interact with each other. To address this, we developed a model that uses generative behavior patterns, which let authors quickly and reliably generate realistic and entertaining NPC scripts. The approach has proven successful, even in the challenging area of creating interactions between NPCs. This article is part of a special issue on interactive entertainment.},

  abstract={Numerous children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit abnormal eye gaze pattern in communication and social interaction. In this study, we aim to investigate the effectiveness of the hide-and-seek virtual reality system (HSVRS) in improving gaze fixation abilities in children with ASD. Our hypothesis is that engaging in a hide-and-seek game within a virtual environment, particularly with a customized avatar resembling a familiar figure, would significantly enhance gaze fixation skills compared to traditional interventions without supplementary virtual reality (VR) intervention. In total, 36 children with ASD were involved in this pilot study in three groups: the avatar customized group, the avatar uncustomized group, and the control group. The control group only received human intervention, while the avatar group received additional VR-assisted interventions. The effect of HSVRS was measured by a six-point Likert subjective questionnaire and demonstrated significant improvements in gaze fixation abilities in the VR-assisted intervention groups compared to the control group ($P$ = 0.006, 0.001). Moreover, the avatar customized group, which interacted with a familiar-looking avatar, obtained noticeable increments in gaze fixation metrics ($P$ = 0.036, 0.005, 0.001). Experimental results show the effectiveness of utilizing VR technology to complement regular interventions in terms of improving gaze fixation abilities for young children with ASD.},

  abstract={Pedestrians comprise a major component of the transport system and their incorporation in the design of future cities is of vital importance. The development of C-ITS systems requires real-time information concerned with the accurate position and kinematics of pedestrians. Therefore, it necessitates the existence of reliable pedestrian simulation models. The objective of this study is the exploration of the existing tools considering modeling techniques and data collection technologies for pedestrian simulation under normal conditions and their interrelations within the framework of pedestrian simulation towards the design and implementation of future simulation approaches. To achieve this, an overview of the main microscopic modeling techniques and data collection methods i.e., emerging positioning technologies is presented, with their potentials and limitations being demonstrated through the existing state-of-the-art. Pedestrian simulation is then approached employing two core elements: conceptual and operational factors. The challenges that these factors entail considering modeling techniques and positioning technologies are elaborated. Last, simulation performance is discussed and future prospects relevant to research needs considering both pedestrian modeling techniques and emerging positioning technologies are proposed.},

  abstract={LeDoux [LeDoux, J. E. The emotional brain. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1996] motivated the direct route in his dual-pathway model by arguing that the ability to switch rapidly between different modes of behavior is highly adaptive. This motivation was supported by evolutionary simulations [den Dulk, P., Heerebout, B. T., & Phaf, R. H. A computational study into the evolution of dual-route dynamics for affective processing. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 15, 194–208, 2003], in which foraging agents, controlled by simple inheritable neural networks, navigated an artificial world while avoiding predation. After many generations, a dual-processing architecture evolved that enabled a rapid switch to avoidance behavior when a predator appeared. We added recurrent connections to a new “context” layer in the indirect pathway to provide the agents with a working memory of previous input (i.e., a “context”). Unexpectedly, agents with oscillating networks emerged that had a much higher fitness than agents without oscillations. Oscillations seemed to have similar effects on switching speed as the dual-processing architecture, but they enhanced switching efficacy to a much larger degree. There has been much neurobiological speculation on the function, if any, of neural oscillations. These findings suggest that the facilitation of switching behavior is a likely candidate. Moreover, the strongly improved adaptation in the simulations contradicts the position that neural oscillations are merely a by-product of cell firing and have no functional value [Pareti, G., & De Palma, A. Does the brain oscillate? The dispute on neuronal synchronization. Neurological Sciences, 25, 41–47, 2004].},

  abstract={For the simulation of linear and nonlinear circuits it is important that the unavoidable errors which are caused by the discretization in time and by the quantization of signals do not change the properties of the circuit in an inadmissible manner. Especially, this is valid for the errors which may result from the applied numerical methods, e.g. for the integration. The effects of various numerical methods can easily be studied at a simple circuit. In particular, nonlinear circuits are well suited because they are very sensitive to small changes of their element parameters. In this paper, a simple RLC circuit containing a nonlinear capacitance is simulated. The circuit exhibits a chaotic dynamic and, if driven by a sinusoidal input, produces subharmonic oscillations. The simulation is based on the well-known wave digital (WD) filter principles, i.e., as signal parameters wave quantities are used and the integration is performed according to the trapezoidal rule. The advantages of WD simulation are demonstrated by showing that the results are not very much affected if the sample rate is changed within certain limits.<>},

Based on the 3-D simulation results, when the width of the FD SOI NMOS device is scaled down to 0.05 mum, the inner-sidewall-oxide fringing capacitance (CFIS), due to the fringing electric field at the edge of the mesa-isolated structure of the FD SOI NMOS device biased at VG=0.3 V and VD=1 V, is the second largest contributor to the gate-source capacitance (C GS). Thus, when using nanometer CMOS devices with a channel width smaller than 0.1 mum, CFIS cannot be overlooked for modeling gate-source/drain capacitance (CGS/CGD)},

  year={2023},
  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={31323-31340},
  abstract={Data mining has been widely used in healthcare to provide treatment and care recommendations based on the collective predictions of individual conditions. Various data mining techniques have been applied for rehabilitation to predict and recommend suitable recovery paths and training. In addition, the gamification concept was applied to rehabilitation training to motivate the patients to follow the training until the end. Considerable research has been conducted to investigate the validity and effectiveness of these techniques using massive patient data on specific conditions and treatment contexts. However, it is still unclear how to effectively offer customized rehabilitation training for stroke patients using gamification and data mining approaches. Thus, to understand how researchers studied them, we examined 34 peer-reviewed articles published in computer science and medical proceedings and journals between 2012 and 2022. We systematically reviewed the data mining and gamification techniques researchers had applied for post-stroke rehabilitation and related prediction models resulting from the data mining processes. As a result of the analyses, three significant contributions are identified. This article 1) identifies trends in data mining and gamification used in personalized post-stroke rehabilitation training; 2) maps trends in the study of data mining and gamification in post-stroke rehabilitation; and 3) identifies underexplored studies for future work. There is a definite need to continue developing and researching intervention strategies related to rehabilitation to address recovery problems by providing accuracy and protection of healthcare, as well as incorporating components that promote patients’ motivation and engagement.},
