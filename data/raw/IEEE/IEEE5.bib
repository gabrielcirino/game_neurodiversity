  abstract={Online gaming has become a significant sensation in today's society, most notably with massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs). These games attract large crowds, some more populated than a small country, all interacting together within a fantasy world. As the Internet has developed throughout the years, so has the online gaming culture. According to Forbes, in 2014, more than 400 million players played MMORPGs globally. The most popular MMORPG is World of Warcraft, which has an estimated 11 million subscribers. This article investigates and analyzes how World of Warcraft has created a complicated online gaming community and resulted in detrimental effects on real-life relationships by conjuring issues such as bullying and addiction.},

  abstract={Power system simulations that extend over a time period of minutes, hours, or even longer are called extended-term simulations. As power systems evolve into complex systems with increasing interdependencies and richer dynamic behaviors across a wide range of timescales, extended-term simulation is needed for many power system analysis tasks (e.g., resilience analysis, renewable energy integration, cascading failures), and there is an urgent need for efficient and robust extended-term simulation approaches. The conventional approaches are insufficient for dealing with the extended-term simulation of multi-timescale processes. This paper proposes an extended-term simulation approach based on the semi-analytical simulation (SAS) methodology. Its accuracy and computational efficiency are backed by SAS's high accuracy in event-driven simulation, larger and adaptive time steps, and flexible switching between full-dynamic and quasi-steady-state (QSS) models. We used this proposed extended-term simulation approach to evaluate bulk power system restoration plans, and it demonstrates satisfactory accuracy and efficiency in this complex simulation task.},

  abstract={The healthcare industry faces significant challenges in managing and processing large volumes of unstructured, real-time medical data. As such, there is a growing need for advanced techniques to handle complex data in the diagnosis of disorders like Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This study presents a Big Data and Machine Learning-based Medical Data Classification (BDML-MDCASD) model aimed at improving the accuracy and efficiency of ASD diagnosis. The proposed model employs an improved Squirrel Search Algorithm-based Feature Selection (ISSA-FS) to identify the most relevant features from medical data. Additionally, a hybrid classification approach is introduced, combining Autoencoder (AE) with the Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (BOA) to enhance detection accuracy. To manage and process large datasets effectively, the MapReduce tool is used for efficient data handling. The model was evaluated across multiple ASD datasets, including ASD-Children (292 instances), ASD-Adolescent (104 instances), and ASD-Adult (704 instances). Simulation results demonstrate that the BDML-MDCASD model outperforms traditional methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 92%, precision of 90%, and recall of 93%. These results underscore the potential of the proposed model in providing a robust, automated solution for early ASD detection, offering a significant advancement over existing diagnostic methods.},

  abstract={This article presents an overview of the design of our digital game, Let's Argue. The project is an immanent critique of digital media, particularly the conventions of social and game applications as affording productive discourse between people, groups, and organizations. Focusing upon the concept of dialogue and its importance to society, we employ satire as a style, lampooning “social games” such as FarmVille and Candy Crush Saga. In aping, disrupting, and toying with these applications’ representational and ludic facets, we provoke our users into considering how the medium, far from being neutral, shapes behavior and motivation.},

  abstract={In today’s technological and digital society, education in digital competencies through which students can make critical and safe use of the Information Society Technologies for work, leisure, and communication, is essential. This paper presents a serious game based on interactive fiction for the self-assessment of digital competence according to the DigComp European model. In addition, it describes the evaluation of the perception of use of the serious game to assess the digital competence of secondary school students, in terms of user experience and usability, with the goal to obtain indications of the software quality of the developed digital tool from the point of view of teachers. The obtained results provide positive evidence of the effectiveness of the serious game as a tool for the assessment of students’ digital competence and the motivation of students towards the use of this kind of resource instead of traditional methods.

  title={Implementing Adaptive Game Difficulty Balancing in Serious Games}, 
  year={2019},
  volume={11},
  number={4},
  pages={320-327},
  abstract={The ability to engage and retain players is perceived as a major factor in the success of games. However, the end-goal of retention differs between entertainment and serious contexts. For an entertainment game, engagement and retention are linked to monetization; for a serious game, this needs to persist for as long as is required for learning or behavioral objectives to be met. User engagement is strongest when a balance is achieved between difficulty and skill, leading to a state of “flow.” Hence, adapting difficulty could lead to increased and sustained engagement. Implementing this requires the identification of variables linked to mechanics, manipulated based upon a player performance model. In some cases, this is possible by adjusting simple properties of objects, though more comprehensive solutions require extending or adapting content applying procedural techniques. This paper proposes a six step plan, validated against two case studies: an existing serious game, with easily manipulated parameters, and a platformer game built from scratch, where additional content is required, showing the process for different mechanics. To explore limitations, the results of two small-scale user evaluations with 45 users in total, are reported, contributing to the understanding of how adaptive difficulty might be implemented and received.},

  abstract={We present the design and evaluation of Astrojumper, an immersive virtual reality exergame developed to motivate players to engage in rigorous, full-body exercise. We performed a user study with 30 people between the ages of 6 and 50 who played the game for 15 min. Regardless of differences in age, gender, activity level, and video game experience, participants rated Astrojumper extremely positively and experienced a significant increase in heart rate after gameplay. Additionally, we found that participants' ratings of perceived workout intensity positively correlated with their level of motivation. Overall, our results demonstrate that Astrojumper effectively motivates both children and adults to exercise through immersive virtual reality technology and a simple, yet engaging, game design.},

  pages={2193-2205},
  abstract={This paper presents an agent-based modeling framework for affordance-based driving behaviors during the exit maneuver of driver agents in human-integrated transportation problems. We start our discussion from one novel modeling framework based on the concept of affordance called the affordancebased finite state automata (AFSA) model, which incorporates the human perception of resource availability and action capability. Then, the agent-based simulation illustrates the validity of the AFSA framework for the highway-lane-driver system. Next, the comparative study between real driving data and agent-based simulation outputs is provided using the transition diagram. Finally, we perform a statistical analysis and a correlation study to analyze affordance-based driving behavior of driver agents. The simulation results show that the AFSA model well represents the perception-based human actions and drivers' characteristics, which are essential for the design viewpoint of control framework of human driver modeling. This paper is also expected to benefit a designed control for autonomous/self-driving car in the future.},

  title={Short-Term Lateral Behavior Reasoning for Target Vehicles Considering Driver Preview Characteristic}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={23},
  number={8},
  pages={11801-11810},
  abstract={A timely understanding of target vehicles (TVs) lateral behavior is essential for the decision-making and control of host vehicle. Existing physical model-based methods such as motion-based method and multiple centerline-based method are generally constructed based on TV pose and longitudinal velocity, and tend to ignore TV preview driving characteristic and other useful information such as lateral velocity and yaw rate. To address these issues, a driver preview and multiple centerline model-based probabilistic behavior recognition architecture is proposed for timely and accurate TV lateral behavior prediction. Firstly, a driver preview model is used to describe vehicle preview driving characteristic, and TV preview lateral offset and preview lateral velocity are calculated with TV states and road reference information. Then, the preview lateral offset and preview lateral velocity are combined with multiple centerline model for TV lateral behavior reasoning based on the interacting multiple model-based probabilistic behavior recognition algorithm. With this method, TV preview driving characteristic and lateral motion states are combined for precise TV lateral behavior description. Furthermore, to predict short-term lateral behavior, a preview lateral velocity-dependent transition probability matrix model constructed with Gaussian cumulative distribution function is proposed. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method considering vehicle preview driving characteristic predicts TV lateral behavior earlier than the conventional method.},

  title={Personalized Control Strategy of Electronic Brake Booster With Driving Behaviors Identification}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={70},
  number={12},
  pages={12593-12603},
  abstract={To improve the comfort and user acceptance of the intelligent vehicle braking system, this paper proposes a control strategy for the electronic brake booster (Ebooster) that considers differences in driving behaviors. First, a real-vehicle driving data collection platform is built to collect the driving behavior data of 84 drivers under typical vehicle-following braking conditions. Subsequently, the k-means clustering algorithm optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to realize the cluster analysis of driving behaviors, and the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm optimized by the genetic algorithm (GA) is used to complete the identification of driving behaviors. Next, through the analysis of the boost characteristics of the self-designed Ebooster, driving behaviors are matched with boost characteristics, and a personalized basic boosting control strategy based on the driver behavior is designed. Finally, a hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) bench and a real-vehicle test platform are designed and built to verify the effectiveness of the personalized control strategy of the Ebooster. The results show that this method can effectively identify the type of driver and make personalized adjustments to the basic boosting strategy of the Ebooster, which effectively improves the personalization of the braking system, resulting in a higher pedal response and user acceptance.},

  pages={2572-2585},
  abstract={Studies have shown that autonomous vehicles (AVs) behave conservatively in a traffic environment composed of human drivers and do not adapt to local conditions and socio-cultural norms. It is known that socially aware AVs can be designed if there exists a mechanism to understand the behaviors of human drivers. We present an approach that leverages machine learning to predict, the behaviors of human drivers. This is similar to how humans implicitly interpret the behaviors of drivers on the road, by only observing the trajectories of their vehicles. We use graph-theoretic tools to extract driver behavior features from the trajectories and machine learning to obtain a computational mapping between the extracted trajectory of a vehicle in traffic and the driver behaviors. Compared to prior approaches in this domain, we prove that our method is robust, general, and extendable to broad-ranging applications such as autonomous navigation. We evaluate our approach on real-world traffic datasets captured in the U.S., India, China, and Singapore, as well as in simulation.},

  abstract={Most existing studies on computational modeling of neural plasticity have focused on synaptic plasticity. However, regulation of the internal weights in the reservoir based on synaptic plasticity often results in unstable learning dynamics. In this article, a structural synaptic plasticity learning rule is proposed to train the weights and add or remove neurons within the reservoir, which is shown to be able to alleviate the instability of the synaptic plasticity, and to contribute to increase the memory capacity of the network as well. Our experimental results also reveal that a few stronger connections may last for a longer period of time in a constantly changing network structure, and are relatively resistant to decay or disruptions in the learning process. These results are consistent with the evidence observed in biological systems. Finally, we show that an echo state network (ESN) using the proposed structural plasticity rule outperforms an ESN using synaptic plasticity and three state-of-the-art ESNs on four benchmark tasks.},

  abstract={In the large-scale group decision-making (LSGDM) problems, some experts may adopt strategic manipulation behaviors which can be reflected in trust and preference values. These behaviors can bias or hinder the large-scale consensus reaching process. This article proposes a novel consensus framework to deal with these strategic manipulation behaviors from the perspective of historical data of trust and preference values in LSGDM. In the proposed consensus framework, the experts are classified into several clusters using the historical data of trust and preference values. Next, the strategic manipulation behaviors of trust and preference values of clusters are identified, respectively. Then, we take the penalty strategy against experts in clusters with two kinds of strategic manipulation behaviors by updating experts’ weights. Simulation and comparison studies are employed to show the validity of the proposed consensus framework against traditional frameworks for managing strategic manipulation behaviors in LSGDM.},

  abstract={Propagation behaviors of radio waves through plasma are an essential issue in both science and engineering research. Many numerical methods are proposed to simulate the behaviors, in which the scattering matrix method (SMM) is one of the most popular techniques. However, the SMM available still has important shortcomings existing in the physical modeling aspect, which will result in numerical divergence in calculations. With the analysis of the scattering matrix theory, a new physical modeling method is presented to eliminate this problem. Then, based on the reconstructed model, a modified SMM is developed. Numerical examples indicate its correctness and ability to overcome the divergence phenomenon. Finally, the method is applied to investigate the propagation behaviors of radio waves in plasma boards coupling with uniform magnetic fields, and some particular behaviors are found, such as transmission stopband of the plasma plate. These results can present a new approach for plasma simulation related to the electromagnetic computation and provide further insights into plasma effects on propagations of electromagnetic waves (EMs).},

  abstract={In the social psychology literature, crowds are classified as audiences and mobs. Audiences are passive crowds, whereas mobs are active crowds with emotional, irrational and seemingly homogeneous behavior. In this study, we aim to create a system that enables the specification of different crowd types ranging from audiences to mobs. In order to achieve this goal we parametrize the common properties of mobs to create collective misbehavior. Because mobs are characterized by emotionality, we describe a framework that associates psychological components with individual agents comprising a crowd and yields emergent behaviors in the crowd as a whole. To explore the effectiveness of our framework we demonstrate two scenarios simulating the behavior of distinct mob types.},

The proposed method is applied to a special switched reluctance motor with asymmetric pole geometry to improve the start-up torque. The pole shape has been optimized, subject to low torque ripple, in a previous study. The proposed approach here is used to analyze the impact of the optimization on the overall acoustic behavior. The field-circuit coupling is based on a temporary lumped-parameter model of the magnetic part incorporated into a circuit simulation based on the modified nodal analysis. The harmonic force excitation is calculated by means of stress tensor computation, and it is transformed to a mechanical mesh by mapping techniques. The structural dynamic problem is solved in the frequency domain using a finite-element modal analysis and superposition. The radiation characteristic is obtained from boundary element acoustic simulation. Simulation results of both rotor types are compared, and measurements of the drive are presented.},

  pages={1028-1032},
  abstract={This paper deals with simulation of cathode-spot motion in the self-consistent magnetic field in 3-D formulation. Plasma jets are modeled as cylinders of a small radius, their conductivity depending on the magnetic field. Electrodes are modeled in their actual 3-D geometry. The magnitude and direction of the velocity of the cathode-spot motion versus the magnetic-field components are taken from the experimental data on the motion of a single spot. The dependence of the cathode-jet conductivity on the magnetic field is found by means of interpolating the Volt-Tesla characteristics (VTCs) for a single spot from the same work. Use is made of the mechanism for spot splitting at currents exceeding some threshold of the current and spot destruction at currents lower than another threshold. Attainment of the steady state by the voltage across the discharge was studied and found to take place after the spots reach the electrode edge. The temporal dependences of the histograms of spot distribution in the current were derived. The obtained results are used to plot the VTC of a system of spots. The qualitative behavior of the dependences agrees with experiment, which is an argument in favor of the assumption that the behavior of a high-current arc is determined to a large extent by that of a system of individual cathode spots interacting via the common self-consistent magnetic field.},

  abstract={Hajj is a mass gathering event that takes place annually in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. Typically, around three million people participate in the event and perform rituals that involve their movements within strict space and time restrictions. Despite efforts by the Hajj organisers, such massive crowd gathering and movement cause overcrowding related problems at the Hajj sites. Several previous simulation studies on Hajj focused on the rituals individually. Tawaf, followed by Sayee, are two important rituals that are performed by all the pilgrims at the same venue on the same day. These events have a strong potential for crowd buildup and related problems. As opposed the previous works in the literature, in this paper we study these two events jointly, rather than separately. We use ExtendSim, a Discrete Event Simulation tool, to integrate the Tawaf and Sayee rituals into one model. The validated model was applied to a wide range of scenarios where different percentages of pilgrims were allocated to the various Tawaf and Sayee areas. The effect of such allocations on the time to complete Tawaf and Sayee indicate strategies for managing these two key Hajj rituals.},

  abstract={Over the past decade, there has been a significant surge in consumer application services and server connectivity, and this trend is expected to double in 2030. The primary contributors to the increased demand for network resources are devices connected through third-party service providers and mobile operators. Many prominent consumer services rely on a client-server architecture, which can introduce latency delays in the communication channel. Additionally, peer-to-peer (P2P) communication places a substantial load on eHealth servers, leading to service delays. In this research paper, we propose a model for scheduling heterogeneous workloads and recommending resources for eHealth edge-cloud connectivity using Federated Split Learning (FSL) model for smart cities. Distributed FSL offers a robust solution for handling both direct and indirect user requests through a distributed mobile core operator stack. This technique empowers eHealth administrators to locally learn optimal policies and make informed decisions by prioritizing resource allocation and scheduling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique through an active simulation server designed for track-driven caching policy and local policy scheduling, ultimately enhancing resource recommendation in eHealth applications. The proposed technique is focused on the development of a heterogeneous workload recommendation system and obtained accuracy of 89.63% over 200 users trails.},

  year={2006},
  volume={18},
  number={7},
  pages={1098-1111},
  abstract={In linguistic theories of how sentences encode meaning, a distinction is often made between the context-free rule-based combination of lexical-semantic features of the words within a sentence (“semantics”), and the contributions made by wider context (“pragmatics”). In psycholinguistics, this distinction has led to the view that listeners initially compute a local, context-independent meaning of a phrase or sentence before relating it to the wider context. An important aspect of such a two-step perspective on interpretation is that local semantics cannot initially be overruled by global contextual factors. In two spoken-language event-related potential experiments, we tested the viability of this claim by examining whether discourse context can overrule the impact of the core lexical-semantic feature animacy, considered to be an innate organizing principle of cognition. Two-step models of interpretation predict that verb-object animacy violations, as in “The girl comforted the clock,” will always perturb the unfolding interpretation process, regardless of wider context. When presented in isolation, such anomalies indeed elicit a clear N400 effect, a sign of interpretive problems. However, when the anomalies were embedded in a supportive context (e.g., a girl talking to a clock about his depression), this N400 effect disappeared completely. Moreover, given a suitable discourse context (e.g., a story about an amorous peanut), animacy-violating predicates (“the peanut was in love”) were actually processed more easily than canonical predicates (“the peanut was salted”). Our findings reveal that discourse context can immediately overrule local lexical-semantic violations, and therefore suggest that language comprehension does not involve an initially context-free semantic analysis.},

The model was implemented in conventional SPICE-like circuit simulators, including HSPICE, and used to simulate key features of VCSEL LI curves, namely, thermally dependent threshold current and output-power roll-over for a range of ambient temperatures. The use of the rate equations also allows simulation in other non-dc operating regimes. Our results compare favorably to experimental data from three devices reported in the literature.},

  pages={847-857},
  abstract={Simulation study on evacuation scenarios has gained tremendous attention in recent years. Two major research challenges remain along this direction: (1) how to portray the effect of individuals' adaptive behaviors under various situations in the evacuation procedures and (2) how to simulate complex evacuation scenarios involving huge crowds at the individual level due to the ultrahigh complexity of these scenarios. In this study, a simulation framework for general evacuation scenarios has been developed. Each individual in the scenario is modeled as an adaptable and autonomous agent driven by a weight-based decision-making mechanism. The simulation is intended to characterize the individuals' adaptable behaviors, the interactions among individuals, among small groups of individuals, and between the individuals and the environment. To handle the second challenge, this study adopts GPGPU to sustain massively parallel modeling and simulation of an evacuation scenario. An efficient scheme has been proposed to minimize the overhead to access the global system state of the simulation process maintained by the GPU platform. The simulation results indicate that the “adaptability” in individual behaviors has a significant influence on the evacuation procedure. The experimental results also exhibit the proposed approach's capability to sustain complex scenarios involving a huge crowd consisting of tens of thousands of individuals.},

  year={2019},
  volume={68},

  pages={6391-6402},
  abstract={Considering the difficulty and high cost of collecting sufficient data in the real world, driving simulators are used in many studies as an alternative data source, which can provide a much easier and safer way to collect driving data. However, because of the inherent differences between the virtual and real world, the recognition model for driving behavior trained using simulation-based data cannot fit the real driving scenes well. To fill the gap between simulation and real data, a knowledge transfer framework is proposed in this paper. Two transfer learning (TL) methods namely semi-supervised manifold alignment (SMA) and kernel manifold alignment (KEMA) are used in the proposed framework to map the data collected from the virtual and real world to one latent common space. A typical lane-changing scenario is selected for a case study. Three classifiers are trained in the latent space and used to do the lane-changing behavior recognition in the real world. In this way, sufficient simulation data are transferred to supplement the training set with few labeled real data, and thus improve the performance of behavior recognition in the real world. Compared with the traditional methods without knowledge transfer, classifiers combined with TL can reduce the error rate of recognition from around 30% (when only the real data are used) or higher than 50% (when only the simulation data are used) to as low as 11%.},

  abstract={Game engines are increasingly used as simulation platforms by the autonomous vehicle community to develop vehicle control systems and test environments. A key requirement for simulation-based development and verification is determinism, since a deterministic process will always produce the same output given the same initial conditions and event history. Thus, in a deterministic simulation environment, tests are rendered repeatable and yield simulation results that are trustworthy and straightforward to debug. However, game engines are seldom deterministic. This paper reviews and identifies the potential causes and effects of non-deterministic behaviours in game engines. A case study using CARLA, an open-source autonomous driving simulation environment powered by Unreal Engine, is presented to highlight its inherent shortcomings in providing sufficient precision in experimental results. Different configurations and utilisations of the software and hardware are explored to determine an operational domain where the simulation precision is sufficiently high i.e. variance between repeated executions becomes negligible for development and testing work. Finally, a method of a general nature is proposed, that can be used to find the domains of permissible variance in game engine simulations for any given system configuration.},

  abstract={For route choice during an outside emergency evacuation, evacuees make different route choice decisions due to their preference diversity. Furthermore, uncertainties of human behavior are inevitable, leading to a high complexity of macroscopic traffic flows and great impact on the evacuation efficiency. In this work, a simulation-based evacuation traffic planning is presented for homogenizing the network traffic flows. In the simulation, the evacuees are divided into two types: panicky and rational ones, and their route choice behavior is captured by two distinct models, respectively. The proportion of panicky evacuees is dynamically changed based on the traffic information level (TIL) and traffic states of downstream links at a decision point. Type-II fuzzy logic system (T2FLS) is used to model the uncertainties of evacuees’ subjective perception on route costs. Comprehensive numerical experiments are done to analyze the impact of TIL, behavior diversity, and the heterogeneity of macroscopic traffic flows on evacuation efficiency. Results show that the proposed evacuation traffic planning is beneficial for improving the evacuation efficiency, alleviating the proportion of panicky evacuees, and homogenizing traffic flows in a large-scale network.},

  abstract={The complexity of biological tissue morphogenesis makes in silico simulations of such system very interesting in order to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms ruling the development of multicellular tissues. This complexity is mainly due to two elements: firstly, biological tissues comprise a large amount of cells; secondly, these cells exhibit complex interactions and behaviors. To address these two issues, we propose two tools: the first one is a virtual cell model that comprise two main elements: firstly, a mechanical structure (membrane, cytoskeleton, and cortex) and secondly, the main behaviors exhibited by biological cells, i.e., mitosis, growth, differentiation, molecule consumption, and production as well as the consideration of the physical constraints issued from the environment. An artificial chemistry is also included in the model. This virtual cell model is coupled to an agent-based formalism. The second tool is a simulator that relies on the OpenCL framework. It allows efficient parallel simulations on heterogenous devices such as micro-processors or graphics processors. We present two case studies validating the implementation of our model in our simulator: cellular proliferation controlled by cell signalling and limb growth in a virtual organism.},

  abstract={Data-driven cooperative control of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) has gained extensive research interest as it can utilize collected data to generate control actions without relying on parametric system models that are generally challenging to obtain. Existing methods mainly focused on improving traffic safety and stability, while less emphasis has been placed on energy efficiency in the presence of uncertainties and diversities of human-driven vehicles (HDVs). In this brief, we employ a Data-EnablEd Predictive Control (DeePC) scheme to address the eco-driving of mixed traffic flows with diverse behaviors of human drivers. Specifically, by incorporating first-order physics, we propose the physics-augmented DeePC (PA-DeePC) approach to handle substantial system variations and uncertainties. Then, a novel optimization framework, avoiding conventional reference trajectories during the receding optimization process, is proposed to further reduce the holistic energy consumption of mixed traffic flows. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately capturing random human driver behaviors and reducing holistic energy consumption, while ensuring driving safety and traffic efficiency. Furthermore, the proposed optimization framework achieves substantial reductions in energy consumption, i.e., average reductions of 4.14%, 4.97%, and 9.29% when compared to the benchmark algorithms.},

  abstract={In interactive narratives, experience management is used to control the world and the nonplayer characters (NPCs) a player interacts with, encouraging particular types of stories or discouraging others. The space of all stories in a narrative can be understood as a story graph, with story states as nodes and actions in the story as directed edges. In this article, we present experience management as a graph pruning problem. Starting with the full story graph, edges representing NPC actions may be pruned until there is at most one action per NPC per state. With the full graph available, the choice of what to prune may consider all possible futures, and we can ensure that undesirable stories are not reachable. By never pruning player actions, we ensure the player may make any choice and still be accommodated in the story. When this method was used to manage the story of an adventure game, players found our technique generally produced higher agency and more-believable NPC behaviors than a control. Finally, we discuss scaling the results of this method for practical use.},

  pages={2129-2138},
  abstract={For realistic surgical simulation in a virtual environment, in vivo material properties of biological tissues are required for simulating the deformations and the reaction forces from the tool-tissue interactions. In this paper, the in vivo static and dynamic mechanical behavior of the liver and lower esophagus of pigs were presented both in linear and nonlinear regions under compressive and shear indentations. A robotic device was programmed to function as a mechanical stimulator with a 2-mm flat-tipped cylindrical probe attached to its tip. A series of ramp and hold stimuli, as well as sinusoidal indentation stimuli, were delivered to the organs and reaction forces were measured. The conditions for these indentation stimuli were designed such that they were similar to conditions in an operating room. Experiments were also carried out on the organs for ex vivo and in vitro conditions. Results show that the breathing and pulse rate significantly affect the measured force responses of the organs. From the obtained force-displacement relationships, steady-state impedances as well as dynamic impedances of both organs were calculated. The results also show that in vivo steady-state impedance of the lower esophagus is significantly higher than that of the liver. The in vivo steady-state response of the liver, however, exhibits a greater degree of nonlinearity than that of the lower esophagus. The in vivo steady-state response of the lower esophagus in the three orthogonal directions also indicates that the lower esophagus is not significantly anisotropic. The impedance of both organs under sinusoidal indentations (0–5 Hz) are fairly similar each other. Magnitudes of the impedance over the stimulus frequencies are fairly constant. The impedance phase angles decrease over the range of stimulus frequencies applied. Comparison of the measurements obtained from the in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro experiments shows that the mechanical properties of the biological tissues change significantly after the death of the animal. The tissues generally become stiffer and exhibit greater nonlinearity. The degree of change in their mechanical properties is dependent on the amount of time after the death of the animal. These data can be further utilized in the computing of the material parameters of tissue models for laparoscopic surgery simulators as well as open surgery simulators.},

  abstract={The aim of this study is to establish the effect of task-oriented video gaming on using a myoelectric prosthesis in a basic activity of daily life (ADL). Forty-one able-bodied right-handed participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups. In three of these groups the participants trained to control a video game using the myosignals of the flexors and extensors of the wrist: in the Adaptive Catching group participants needed to catch falling objects by opening and closing a grabber and received ADL-relevant feedback during performance. The Free Catching group used the same game, but without augmented feedback. The Interceptive Catching group trained a game where the goal was to intercept a falling object by moving a grabber to the left and right. They received no additional feedback. The control group played a regular Mario computer game. All groups trained 20 minutes a day for four consecutive days. Two tests were conducted before and after training: one level of the training game was performed, and participants grasped objects with a prosthesis simulator. Results showed all groups improved their game performance over controls. In the prosthesis-simulator task, after training the Adaptive Catching group outperformed the other groups in their ability to adjust the hand aperture to the size of the objects and the degree of compression of compressible objects. This study is the first to demonstrate transfer effects from a serious game to a myoelectric prosthesis task. The specificity of the learning effects suggests that research into serious gaming will benefit from placing ADL-specific constraints on game development.},

  pages={1137-1153},
  abstract={This paper proposes two methods to improve the performance in real-time simulation. The increased inverter-based generations are gradually shifting the operation of the power grid. Consequently, the investigation for the safe operation and further application is essential in the inverter-dominated power grid. As the simulated number of non-linear switch elements like inverter increases, the numerical complexity of the simulation model rises exponentially. Accordingly, the scale of the simulated power grid with inverters is normally constricted by taking account of the burdensome numerical calculation. The emerging of real-time simulator provides the opportunity to enable the simulation of the large-scale power grids. Nevertheless, the simulation boundary condition is still exceeded in the inverter-dominated model. Hence, the improvement of the performance to extend the limitation in real-time simulation is constituted in this paper. The first method proposed is co-simulation. This approach is to simulate the power grid and inverters by models in different deep levels. The phasor model and electrical-mechanical-transient model are utilized to develop the co-simulation model. The second method is network reduction. Based on the dynamic feature of the inverter, it is reduced to an equivalent current source, which decreases the complexity of the model and retains its characteristics. The evaluation of the methods is demonstrated by two indexes: real-time capability and the similarity degree.},

It was clear that the proposed model can calculate the hysteresis loop of a ring core with high speed and high accuracy. However, this method was applied only for the objects with simple shapes. Thus, it is necessary to extend the applicable range for the objects with more complicated shapes. This paper presents a novel reluctance network analysis (RNA) model incorporating the play model and indicates the validity of the proposed RNA model by using a three-phase-laminated-core variable inductor as an object of discussion.},

  abstract={The economic system is a complex adaptive system (CAS), which is composed of many heterogeneous, dispersed and interconnected actors. Because of ignoring these features, traditional macroeconomic models have many defects. In view of the fact that economic security problems are characterized by multiple and miscellaneous source data, wide range of involvement and complex behavior, an economic system needs to be simulated. In this paper, based on big data technology, we conduct china's economic security simulation from three aspects: economic security simulation method, economic security simulation modeling and calibration technology, and economic security early warning simulation visualization technology. In the end, we apply the method of this paper to a case study of a rare earth new material company, and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of various safety investment schemes based on the simulation results. Case analysis proves that the method proposed in this paper can simulate economic dynamics to achieve dynamic assessment of economic development and economic security prediction.},

  abstract={Car-following models are essential for microscopic traffic simulation. While conventional models rely on parsimonious formulas with simplified assumptions, recent studies have focused on developing data-driven models with the help of high-resolution trajectory data. This paper presents a data-driven model based on a Bayesian Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for probabilistic forecasting of human car-following behaviors. By incorporating past and future information, our model captures the temporal dynamics of human car-following behaviors, providing accurate predictions of the following vehicle’s behavior and quantifying the forecast uncertainty. We demonstrate the interpretability of the Bayesian GMM in modeling car-following behaviors, providing valuable insights into the heterogeneity and uncertainty of driver behaviors. Additionally, we show that the proposed model can make probabilistic multi-vehicle simulations that reproduce natural traffic phenomena. Our results suggest that the proposed Bayesian GMM is a promising approach for modeling and forecasting car-following behaviors in various driving scenarios, contributing to the development of safer and more efficient transportation systems.},

  year={2024},

  pages={1301-1320},
  abstract={Spiking Neural Network (SNN) simulation is very important for studying brain function and validating the hypotheses for neuroscience, and it can also be used in artificial intelligence. Recently, GPU-based simulators have been developed to support the real-time simulation of SNN. However, these simulators' simulating performance and scale are severely limited, due to the random memory access pattern and the global communication between devices. Therefore, we propose an efficient distributed heterogeneous SNN simulator based on the Sunway accelerators (including SW26010 and SW26010pro), named SWsnn, which supports accurate simulation with small time step (1/16 ms), randomly delay sizes for synapses, and larger scale network computing. Compared with existing GPUs, the Local Dynamic Memory (LDM) (similar to cache) in Sunway is much bigger (4 MB or 16 MB in each core group). To improve the simulation performance, we redesign the network data storage structure and the synaptic plasticity flow to make most random accesses occur in LDM. SWsnn hides Message Passing Interface (MPI)-related operations to reduce communication costs by separating SNN general workflow. Besides, SWsnn relies on parallel Compute Processing Elements (CPEs) rather than serial Manage Processing Element (MPE) to control the communicating buffers, using Register-Level Communication (RLC) and Direct Memory Access (DMA). In addition, SWsnn is further optimized using vectorization and DMA hiding techniques. Experimental results show that SWsnn runs 1.4-2.2 times faster than state-of-the-art GPU-based SNN simulator GPU-enhanced Neuronal Networks (GeNN), and supports much larger scale real-time simulation.},

  abstract={Understanding the interaction between cognitive load and features of video game play is important for the accurate measurement and application of this psychological construct in both research and industry scenarios to enhance the player experience. A challenge within this domain is the use of measurements developed in different areas in video games without first validating or testing the reliability of these tools. We present a holistic evaluation of methods used to measure cognitive load during naturalistic gameplay of a commercially available sandbox game. This study measures electroencephalography, electromyography, heart rate, heart rate variability, electrodermal activity, and eye blink rate from players during a building task in Minecraft whilst being assisted by a virtual companion. Various models reveal that a number of physiological measures can be used as a proxy of subjective cognitive load measurement, providing further insight into the player experience during gameplay. Our analysis also reveals some discriminant validity of the subjective measurement used. These results can help inform the choice of sensor in evaluating video game features, or when needing to accurately measure cognitive load for an adaptive situation or high-risk scenario.},

  abstract={Estimating affective and cognitive states in conditions of rich human-computer interaction, such as in games, is a field of growing academic and commercial interest. Entertainment and serious games can benefit from recent advances in the field as, having access to predictors of the current state of the player (or learner) can provide useful information for feeding adaptation mechanisms that aim to maximize engagement or learning effects. In this paper, we introduce a large data corpus derived from 58 participants that play the popular Super Mario Bros platform game and attempt to create accurate models of player experience for this game genre. Within the view of the current research, features extracted both from player gameplay behavior and game levels, and player visual characteristics have been used as potential indicators of reported affect expressed as pairwise preferences between different game sessions. Using neuroevolutionary preference learning and automatic feature selection, highly accurate models of reported engagement, frustration, and challenge are constructed (model accuracies reach 91%, 92%, and 88% for engagement, frustration, and challenge, respectively). As a step further, the derived player experience models can be used to personalize the game level to desired levels of engagement, frustration, and challenge as game content is mapped to player experience through the behavioral and expressivity patterns of each player.},

The paper applies the new approach of fault primitives to perform this analysis. The analysis shows the existence of most traditional memory fault models and establishes new ones.

  abstract={The role of pancreatic /spl beta/-cells is fundamental in the control endocrine system, maintaining the blood glucose homeostasis in a physiological regime, via the glucose-induced release of insulin. An increasing amount of detailed experimental evidences at the cellular and molecular biology levels have been collected on the key factors determining the insulin release by the pancreatic /spl beta/-cells. The direct transposition of such experimental data into accurate mathematical descriptions might contribute to considerably clarify the impact of each cellular component on the global glucose metabolism. Under these perspectives, we model and computer-simulate the stimulus-secretion coupling in /spl beta/-cells by describing four interacting cellular subsystems, consisting in the glucose transport and metabolism, the excitable electrophysiological behavior, the dynamics of the intracellular calcium ions, and the exocytosis of granules containing insulin. We explicit the molecular nature of each subsystem, expressing the mutual relationships and the feedbacks that determine the metabolic-electrophysiological behavior of an isolated /spl beta/-cell. Finally, we discuss the simulation results of the behavior of isolated /spl beta/-cells as well as of population of electrically coupled /spl beta/-cells in Langerhans islets, under physiological and pathological conditions, including noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and hyperinsulinemic hypoglycaemia (PHHI).},

  abstract={In this study, to reduce the occurrence of risks and risk accidents in the construction stages of engineering projects and strengthen the risk management abilities of the subjects of such projects, prospect theory is introduced into an evolutionary game to construct a risk management behavior game model between owners and contractors in the construction stage. In addition, a government penalty parameter is introduced based on strong reciprocity theory. The intrinsic laws and optimal evolutionary stability strategy in the behavior evolution game between the two parties are analyzed. The influences of different parameter changes on the evolution results are simulated. The study shows that the game model has five local equilibrium points, and that positive risk management for both parties is a stable evolutionary strategy. The factors influencing the evolution results include the cost of positive risk management, risk perception loss and its share ratio, risk perception loss discount coefficient, and negative penalty coefficient. The differences in risk perceptions and effect of prospect theory hinder the behaviors of both parties from evolving towards the optimal strategy. By means of a negative penalty, a strong reciprocal government strategy can effectively coordinate the risk behavior strategies of both parties. Based on the analysis, suggestions are proposed for strengthening the effective management of risks in the construction stages of engineering projects.},

  abstract={Models of overvoltage protection devices, such as transient voltage suppressor diodes (TVS-diodes) are largely available in circuit analyzer tools. For this letter, the widely used circuit simulation tool LTspice was employed and during the course of investigating the simulation of such protection devices in the context of electrical fast transient phenomena, especially electrical fast transients (EFT/BURST) and electrostatic discharge (ESD), certain existing diode-model types can present inaccuracies when predicting the disturbances generated by those devices. Presumably this is the case regarding the model of the junction capacitances, especially for the cutoff region, since the implementation follows a linear extrapolation and therefore differs from the real behavior of the protection device under test. This letter deals with the investigation of a simulation setup and occurring limitations for the analysis of the transient behavior. It should give some encouragement to always consider given model-limitations and how they can affect the simulated results and also if the applicability for certain investigations is provided.},

Therefore, in this letter, the statistics analysis including transient and steady-state behaviors of IWF-SSAF is derived in mean and mean-square senses by virtue of some frequently-utilized assumptions and Price's theorem. Finally, numerical simulations under system identification scenario manifest that the simulated and theoretical results are in good agreement in different environments, which corroborate the accurateness of the derived theoretical models.},

  pages={641-658},
  abstract={Evacuation drills are critical to ensure safety and to evaluate emergency preparedness. However, drills are overly expensive in terms of the involved resources. Before conducting drills, it is possible to test the infrastructure under stress using computer simulation (combined with optimization) to identify critical points (hotspots) that could improve the flow dynamics during a real evacuation or emergency. This article proposes a mesoscopic (optimization-simulation) framework that models the evacuation dynamics from a strategic perspective considering the infrastructure of the evacuated area and the effect of congestion on the evacuation times. The mesoscopic framework iteratively interweaves two models: (i) a macroscopic network-oriented optimization model that finds flows of evacuees toward the safe zones, and (ii) a microscopic discrete-event simulation model that evaluates the effect of congestion. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework, the article presents a case study that recreates a real evacuation drill that took place in a university campus. The results of the case study support infrastructure investment decisions that enhance the evacuation dynamics.},

  abstract={Lubricant behavior within a head-disk clearance in recent hard disk drives was simulated by using a particle method, which is based on continuum dynamics. The lubricant was simulated as a group of particles. The surface tension and the wall-adhesion models used in the particle method were verified before applying the particle method to the lubricant behavior simulation first. That is, simple benchmark problems like liquid-droplet deformations under unbalanced surface tension and wall adhesion force were used to confirm the accuracy of the models. In the lubricant simulation, the effects of viscous stress and surface tension on the lubricant behavior were studied. The study found that viscous stress is the dominant factor in comparison with surface tension on bulk condition of viscosity; that is, the lubricant bridge is deformed by the viscous stress, not by the surface tension.},

  abstract={Technology has become a dominant force in today’s 21st-century education landscape. One of the innovative new technologies in computer-supported collaborative learning that many educators have adopted is game-based learning. This approach optimizes student learning outcomes and ignites enthusiasm, especially in monotonous subjects. This paper investigates the perceived usability of traditional textbook learning and teaching with Game-based learning and teaching in Geosocial science education. We conducted a comprehensive investigation involving thirty seventh-grade junior high school students and ten expert teachers. Participants were assigned to teach and learn both with and without gamification. Data on perceived usability scales were collected through standardized assessments using a 5-point Likert scale. The analysis employed descriptive statistics, independent sample tests, and effect size analysis to evaluate the results. Research shows that game-based learning can significantly improve student and teacher satisfaction and overall learning efficiency. Students using the game-based approach demonstrated substantially higher engagement and learning outcomes than traditional approaches. Although the impact on teaching effectiveness was not significantly different, overall satisfaction and usability evaluations were markedly higher for game-based teaching methods. The findings suggest that the game-based learning and teaching approach greatly enhances learning outcomes and student satisfaction in educational settings for monotonous subjects.},

  abstract={The paper proposes a layered architectural framework to support agent based system development in a collaborative, multidisciplinary engineering setting. This architecture is viewed from two distinct perspectives. First, the environment must enable agent based modeling and simulation. Second, it should support concurrent (team oriented) engineering. The main focus is on the proposed layered architecture delineating various needs of an agent based system, thus supporting incremental specification design, implementation, and testing. In our discussions, we distinguish between performing agents and simulated agents. The former refers to agents as they are performing their tasks in real-world settings. The latter refers to agents that have their behavior simulated in a virtual environment. In these terms, the proposed framework is intended to form the basis for environments that support development of agents, in both performance and simulation modes, as well as in hybrid combination (both performing and simulated agents interacting at the same time). The proposed framework is a step toward realization of agent based systems under the umbrella of the simulation based acquisition (SBA) initiative of the US Department of Defense.},

  year={2022},
  volume={52},
  number={9},
  pages={5746-5757},
  abstract={Ramp merging is considered to be one of the major causes of traffic accidents and congestion due to its inherent chaotic nature. With the development of the connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technology, CAVs can conduct cooperative merging using communication, and can also handle complicated situations even with legacy vehicles. In this article, a game theory-based ramp merging strategy has been developed for the optimal merging coordination of CAVs in mixed traffic, which can determine the dynamic merging sequence and corresponding longitudinal/lateral control. This strategy improves the safety and efficiency of the merging process by ensuring a safe intervehicle distance and harmonizing the speeds of CAVs in the traffic stream. To verify the proposed strategy, mixed traffic simulation runs under different penetration rates and different congestion levels have been carried out on an innovative Unity-SUMO integrated platform, which connects a game engine-based driving simulator with a state-of-the-art microscopic traffic simulator. The results show that the average speed of traffic flow can be increased up to 210%, while the fuel consumption can be reduced up to 53.9%. In addition, the driving volatility can be stabilized to a level with 0% extreme values.},

  abstract={In the prediction of underfill flow in a flip-chip package, numerical methods are usually used for flow analysis and simulation since analytical methods cannot meet the requirement for predicting fluid distribution in a planar analysis. At present, there appears to be no simulation software commercially available that is able to provide adequate prediction for the underfill flow process driven by capillary force in a micro-cavity situation. In the study presented in this paper, a numerical model was proposed for the prediction of flip-chip underfill flow. In this model, the power-law constitutive equation was used to describe the non-Newtonian behavior of encapsulant fluids and a time-dependent velocity boundary condition was used instead of the pressure boundary condition commonly used. The comparison between the model-predicted and experimental results indicated that this model can give a good prediction for the underfill flow in a micro-cavity. This model was implemented by a general-purpose commercially available software program ANSYS, which has a high reliability and wide accessibility.},

  abstract={Advancements in smartphone technology have resulted in the proliferation of Augmented Reality (AR) applications and games. Researchers have acknowledged the great potential of AR applications to enhance entertainment and improve learning experiences. In this study, we examined the potential effects of gamified AR in public places. We developed ARQuiz, an AR-based quiz game, for a public exhibition space and conducted a user study with respondents via survey (N = 176; 55.68% female, mean age 35.94 and SD = 11.89) and face-to-face interview (N = 28; 57.14% female, mean age 31.07 and SD = 7.42). We analyzed the relationship between perceived application usefulness, perceived application enjoyment, perceived exhibition enjoyment, and perceived quiz enjoyment. In addition, we examined perceived sociability before and after the quiz, quiz score, and user behavior in the exhibition space. The results indicate that visitors who enjoyed playing the ARQuiz game enjoyed the exhibition more, obtained better quiz results and felt more social after visiting the exhibition. Furthermore, the ARQuiz was regarded as a possible platform for improving visitors' learning and overall experiences in public exhibitions. Although some players expressed concerns about the privacy and intrusiveness of AR, our results indicate that a well-designed AR game may boost the overall satisfaction of an exhibition visit and increase players' sociabilitys.},

  abstract={Simulation on crowd evacuation has attracted plenty of attention in the past few years. Emotion plays a significant role in human decision making processes and on the behaviors during the evacuation. Moreover, grouping is a common phenomenon in crowds, and there are a lot of roles included in a group. In this paper, we present a unified framework to model the structure aspect of the groups with emotion for a crowd suffering fires and explosions in public areas. The proposed evacuation framework consists of two components: (1) an emotion model for various roles in the case of an emergency. Emotional changing is a complex process where different roles are influenced by different factors. (2) Both intra-group structure and inter-group relationship are considered to simulate the herd phenomenon in emergency. The structure and behaviors of a group are related to the emotions of different roles. A follower can decide whether to leave the group or not according to the emotion of the group leader and the one of his own, thus the members of the group may always dynamically change. Simulation results show that the developed framework can practically model the emotion changing and different group structures of evacuation crowds.},

  abstract={Students’ participation and motivation are of great importance in their learning process. The decrease in attendance and difficulties in stimulating students’ activity makes it necessary to find new methodologies that can solve these problems. The use of game mechanics in non-ludic environments (Gamification) has begun to be of great interest in research, since it could increase the motivation and therefore the activity of the students. This study tries to verify if there is an existing relationship between gamification and a possible increase in student activity or between the cessation of gamification and student activity. In addition, it evaluates whether a greater student activity corresponds to a greater learning improvement. In the obtained results, no significant differences were found between the methodology or the activity with a learning improvement. According to the study, the simple use of gamified elements does not necessarily imply a solution to the problems posed. The students’ activity in a course of these characteristics does not imply a better learning improvement, the importance lies in the quality of the activity generated and not in the quantity.},

  year={2020},
  volume={16},
  number={4},
  pages={2393-2402},
  abstract={In this article, we develop a navigation strategy based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for mobile robots. Because of the large difference between simulation and reality, most of the trained DRL models cannot be directly migrated into real robots. Moreover, how to explore in a sparsely rewarded environment is also a long-standing problem of DRL. This article proposes an end-to-end navigation planner that translates sparse laser ranging results into movement actions. Using this highly abstract data as input, agents trained by simulation can be extended to the real scene for practical application. For map-less navigation across obstacles and traps, it is difficult to reach the target via random exploration. Curiosity is used to encourage agents to explore the state of an environment that has not been visited and as an additional reward for exploring behavior. The agent relies on the self-supervised model to predict the next state, based on the current state and the executed action. The prediction error is used as a measure of curiosity. The experimental results demonstrate that without any manual design features and previous demonstrations, the proposed method accomplishes map-less navigation in complex environments. Through a reward signal that is enhanced by intrinsic motivation, the agent explores more efficiently, and the learned strategy is more reliable.},

  abstract={The digital interactive video exploration and reflection (Diver) system lets users create virtual pathways through existing video content using a virtual camera and an annotation window for commentary. Users can post their Dives to the WebDiver server system to generate active collaboration, further repurposing, and discussion. Although our current work focuses on video records in learning research and educational practices, Diver can aid collaborative analysis of a broad array of visual data records, including simulations, 2D and 3D animations, and static works of art, photography, and text. In addition to the social and behavioral sciences, substantive application areas include medical visualization, astronomic data or cosmological models, military satellite intelligence, and ethnology and animal behavior. Diver-style user-centered video repurposing might also prove compelling for popular media with commercial application involving sports events, movies, television shows, and video gaming. Future technical development includes possible enhancements to the interface to support simultaneous display of multiple Dives on the same source content, a more fluid two-way relation between desktop Diver and WebDiver, and solutions to the current limitations on displaying and authoring time/space cropped videos in a browser context. These developments support the tool's fundamentally collaborative, communication-oriented nature.},

  abstract={In this paper, a parameterized reduced model of a vibratory microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) gyroscope is established using a parametric model order reduction algorithm. In the reduction process, not only the input angular velocity, material density, Young's modulus, and Rayleigh damping coefficient but also the coefficient of thermal expansion and the change in temperature were all preserved. Based on this model, the integrated behavior simulation of the MEMS gyroscope, including many environmental factors in engineering situations, was performed in an accurate and fast way. Compared with the finite-element method, the relative error of the reduced-order model was less than 4.2%, while the computational efficiency was improved about five times. The cosimulation with a complete interface circuit was successfully performed in a very fast way, which provides a convenient platform for designers to evaluate the performance of sensors. The experimental verification proves that the reduced model can provide a reliable simulation result, although some errors exist.},

  abstract={The simultaneous study of brain function at all levels of organization is difficult to undertake with current experimental tools. Present day electrophysiology only allows the recording of at most hundreds of neurons while an animal is performing a behavioral task. Because of this limitation and the sheer complexity of the nervous system, computational modeling has become essential in developing theories of brain function. Accordingly, our group has constructed a series of brain-based devices (BBDs), that is, physical devices with simulated nervous systems that guide behavior, to serve as a heuristic for testing theories of brain function. Unlike animal models, BBDs permit analysis of activity at all levels of the nervous system as the device behaves in its environment. Although the principal focus of developing BBDs has been to test theories of brain function, this type of modeling may also provide a basis for robotic design and practical applications.},

  abstract={Biomedical-connected objects, such as kinematic sensors, have been commonly used for patient monitoring in many clinical applications. Moreover, serious games have become widely used to improve patients' motivation during functional rehabilitation. In this article, we develop and evaluate a new engineering system as a solution for functional rehabilitation at home. A multisensor fusion between Kinect camera and inertial sensors was developed to animate a 3-D avatar during rehabilitation and to estimate kinematic data of different joints for clinical monitoring. Two serious game scenarios were designed for upper and lower limb rehabilitation. The developed system was evaluated through patient kinematic data and a questionnaire-based approach with a panel of eight poststroke patients and four clinical experts. The evaluation of the system showed that multisensor fusion provides useful data for clinical follow-up. The virtual game scenarios lead to a high level of immersion for patients. Feedback from clinical experts concerning the system's graphical user interfaces and the clinical relevance of the acquired data for each rehabilitation session are positive. The developed system paves the way to deploy recent technologies, such as multisensor fusion and serious games, as a solution for home-based rehabilitation, which can optimize the benefit of the involved patients and medical experts.},

  pages={661-671},
  abstract={This article presents a model of the human pilot for an aircraft with a smart inceptor, as a means to mitigate human- vehicle system loss-of-control. A key feature of the pilot model is the capability to reflect the interaction between the human-vehicle interface and the human pilot. The proposed human pilot model is primarily composed of a perception module, adaptation module, and execution module. The visual and tactile cues perceived from the human-vehicle interface including a smart inceptor are utilized to model the perception module. The adaptation module, including the central nervous system, is introduced to describe the adaptive behavior of the human pilot. In addition, the execution module contains the neuromuscular system of the human pilot so that the dynamics of the neuromuscular system and the smart inceptor are considered. The human pilot model is assessed by the time domain and wavelet-based analysis in comparison with the experiments of pilot-in-the-loop flight simulation. The simulation results indicate that the tracking results of the time histories given by this model are in good agreement with the behavioral characteristics of a test pilot. The potential applications of the human pilot model include the design of the smart inceptor and evaluation of aircraft loss-of- control events.},

  abstract={Human factors studies are becoming more and more crucial in the automotive sector due to the need to evaluate the driver.s reactions to the increasingly sophisticated driving-assistant technologies. Driving simulators allow performing this kind of study in a controlled and safe environment. However, the driving simulation.s Level of Detail (LOD) can affect the users. perception of driving scenarios and make an experimental campaign.s outcomes unreliable. This paper proposes a study investigating possible correlations between driver.s behaviors and emotions, and simulated driving scenarios. Four scenarios replicating the same real area were built with four LODs from LOD0 (only the road is drawn) to LOD3 (all buildings with real textures for facades and roofs are inserted together with items visible from the road). 32 participants drove in all the four scenarios on a fixed-base driving simulator; their performance relating to the vehicle control (i.e., speed, trajectory, brake and gas pedal use, and steering wheel), their physiological data (electrodermal activity, and eye movements), their subjective perceptions, opinions and emotional state were measured. The results showed that drivers. behavior changes in a very complex way. Geometrical features of the route and environmental elements constrain much more driving behavior than LOD does Emotions are not affected by LODs. Generally, different signals showed different correlations with the LOD level, suggesting that future studies should consider their measures while modeling the virtual scenario. It is hypothesized that scenario realism is more relevant during leisurely environmental interaction, whilst simulator fidelity is crucial in task-driven interactions.},

  abstract={Real-time strategy (RTS) games are a subgenre of strategy video games. Due to their importance in practical decision-making and digital entertainment over the last two decades, many researchers have explored different algorithmic approaches for controlling agents within RTS games and learning effective strategies and tactics. Among the techniques, coevolutionary algorithms proved to be one of the most popular and successful algorithms for developing such games, in which players can compete or cooperate to achieve the given game’s mission. However, as many alternative designs exist with their analysis and the applications reported in diverse publications, a review covering the evolution of such algorithms would be valuable for researchers and practitioners in this domain. This paper aims to provide a systematic review by highlighting why and how coevolution is used in RTS games and analysis of the recent work. The review conducted follows procedural steps to identify, filter, analyse and discuss the existing literature. This structured review articulates the purposes of using coevolution in RTS games and highlights several open questions for future research in this domain.},

  year={2023},
  volume={14},
  number={4},
  pages={2939-2953},
  abstract={The antagonistic behavior in the crowd usually exacerbates the seriousness of the situation in sudden riots, where the antagonistic emotional contagion and behavioral decision making play very important roles. However, the complex mechanism of antagonistic emotion influencing decision making, especially in the environment of sudden confrontation, has not yet been explored very clearly. In this paper, we propose an Emotional contagion-aware Deep reinforcement learning model for Antagonistic Crowd Simulation (ACSED). First, we build a group emotional contagion module based on the improved Susceptible Infected Susceptible (SIS) infection disease model, and estimate the emotional state of the group at each time step during the simulation. Then, the tendency of crowd antagonistic action is estimated based on Deep Q Network (DQN), where the agent learns the action autonomously, and leverages the mean field theory to quickly calculate the influence of other surrounding individuals on the central one. Finally, the rationality of the predicted actions by DQN is further analyzed in combination with group emotion, and the final action of the agent is determined. The proposed method in this paper is verified through several experiments with different settings. We can conclude antagonistic emotions play a critical role in the decision making of the crowd through influencing the individual behavior in the riot scenario, where individual behaviors are primarily driven by emotions and goals, rather than common rules. The experiment results also prove that the antagonistic emotion has a vital impact on the group combat, and positive emotional states are more conducive to combat. Moreover, by comparing the simulation results with real scenes, the feasibility of our method is further confirmed, which can provide good reference to formulate battle plans and improve the win rate of righteous groups in a variety of situations.},

  abstract={Engineering a high-performance race car requires a direct consideration of the human driver using real-world tests or human-driver-in-the-loop simulations. Alternatively, offline simulations with human-like race driver models could make this vehicle development process more effective and efficient but are hard to obtain due to various challenges. With this work, we intend to provide a better understanding of race driver behavior from expert knowledge and introduce an adaptive human race driver model based on imitation learning. Using existing findings in the literature, complemented with an interview with a race engineer, we identify fundamental adaptation mechanisms and how drivers learn to optimize lap time on a new track. Subsequently, we select the most distinct adaptation mechanisms via a survey with 12 additional experts, to develop generalization and adaptation techniques for a recently presented probabilistic driver modeling approach and evaluate it using data from professional race drivers and a state-of-the-art race car simulator. We show that our framework can create realistic driving line distributions on unseen race tracks with almost human-like performance. Moreover, our driver model optimizes its driving lap by lap, correcting driving errors from previous laps while achieving faster lap times. This work contributes to a better understanding and modeling of the human driver, aiming to expedite simulation methods in the modern vehicle development process and potentially supporting automated driving and racing technologies.},

  abstract={The ability to accurately infer functional connectivity between ensemble neurons using experimentally acquired spike train data is currently an important research objective in computational neuroscience. Point process generalized linear models and maximum likelihood estimation have been proposed as effective methods for the identification of spiking dependency between neurons. However, unfavorable experimental conditions occasionally results in insufficient data collection due to factors such as low neuronal firing rates or brief recording periods, and in these cases, the standard maximum likelihood estimate becomes unreliable. The present studies compares the performance of different statistical inference procedures when applied to the estimation of functional connectivity in neuronal assemblies with sparse spiking data. Four inference methods were compared: maximum likelihood estimation, penalized maximum likelihood estimation, using either l2 or l1 regularization, and hierarchical Bayesian estimation based on a variational Bayes algorithm. Algorithmic performances were compared using well-established goodness-of-fit measures in benchmark simulation studies, and the hierarchical Bayesian approach performed favorably when compared with the other algorithms, and this approach was then successfully applied to real spiking data recorded from the cat motor cortex. The identification of spiking dependencies in physiologically acquired data was encouraging, since their sparse nature would have previously precluded them from successful analysis using traditional methods.},

The study shows that all those techniques entail safety problems, i.e. they would cause collisions in the real world.

  abstract={Gamification approaches to learning use game-inspired design elements to improve learning. Given manifold design options to implement gamification in virtual environments, an important but underexplored research area is how the composition of gamification elements affects learning. To advance research in this area, we systematically identified key design elements that have shown promise in leading to positive learning results. We then conducted an experiment in which we varied gamification intensity in web-based virtual training environments for a procedural industrial task. In total, 355 participants were divided into a baseline group without gamification, a basic, and an advanced gamification group. Analysis of participants’ learning included learning outcomes (time-to-completion and number of mistakes), affective learning factors (motivation, self-efficacy, and satisfaction), learning system usability, and perceived cognitive load throughout the learning process. The results did not show any statistically significant differences between the lower and higher levels of gamification intensity. Conversely, we found that participants’ computer gaming habits and technical equipment (display size and computer pointing device) significantly influenced learning.},

  abstract={A new mechanism is proposed to generate power law behavior in interspike interval (ISI) distribution when a collection of neurons group together and fire together. Employing superstatistical framework, the mechanism requires a population of neurons which is characterized by randomly distributed excitatory and inhibitory rates. The distribution of these rates is characterized by independent gamma variates. The effect of randomness in the rates exhibits power law behavior in first passage time of the integrate and fire (IF) model. Extensive Monte Carlo simulation studies of the underlying stochastic differential equation (SDE) are carried out which also depict asymptotically power law behavior for ISI distribution for an ensemble of IF neurons.},

  abstract={Stochastic simulation algorithms are extensively used for exploring stochastic behavior of biochemical pathways/networks. Computational cost of these algorithms is high in simulating real biochemical systems due to their large size, complex structure and stiffness. In order to reduce the computational cost, several algorithms have been developed. It is observed that these algorithms are basically fast in simulating weakly coupled networks. In case of strongly coupled networks, they become slow as their computational cost become high in maintaining complex data structures. Here, we develop Block Search Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (BlSSSA). BlSSSA is not only fast in simulating weakly coupled networks but also fast in simulating strongly coupled and stiff networks. We compare its performance with other existing algorithms using two hypothetical networks, viz., linear chain and colloidal aggregation network, and three real biochemical networks, viz., B cell receptor signaling network, FceRI signaling network and a stiff 1,3-Butadiene Oxidation network. It has been shown that BlSSSA is faster than other algorithms considered in this study.},

  year={2013},
  volume={43},
  number={6},
  pages={1936-1949},
  abstract={In the manual control of a dynamic system, the human controller (HC) often follows a visible and predictable reference path. Compared with a purely feedback control strategy, performance can be improved by making use of this knowledge of the reference. The operator could effectively introduce feedforward control in conjunction with a feedback path to compensate for errors, as hypothesized in literature. However, feedforward behavior has never been identified from experimental data, nor have the hypothesized models been validated. This paper investigates human control behavior in pursuit tracking of a predictable reference signal while being perturbed by a quasi-random multisine disturbance signal. An experiment was done in which the relative strength of the target and disturbance signals were systematically varied. The anticipated changes in control behavior were studied by means of an ARX model analysis and by fitting three parametric HC models: two different feedback models and a combined feedforward and feedback model. The ARX analysis shows that the experiment participants employed control action on both the error and the target signal. The control action on the target was similar to the inverse of the system dynamics. Model fits show that this behavior can be modeled best by the combined feedforward and feedback model.},

  abstract={A key challenge in robotics is the generation of controllers for autonomous, high-level robot behaviors comprising nontrivial sequences of actions, including reactive and repeated tasks. When constructing controllers to fulfill such tasks, it is often not known a priori whether the intended behavior is even feasible; plans are modified on the fly to deal with failures that occur during execution, often still without guaranteeing correct behavior. Recently, formal methods have emerged as a powerful tool to automatically generate autonomous robot controllers that guarantee desired behaviors expressed by a class of temporal logic specifications. However, when the specification cannot be fulfilled, these approaches do not provide the user with a source of failure, making the troubleshooting of specifications an unstructured and time-consuming process. This paper describes an algorithm to automatically analyze an unsynthesizable specification in order to identify causes of failure. It also introduces an interactive game to explore possible causes of unsynthesizability, in which the user attempts to fulfill the robot specification against an adversarial environment. The proposed algorithm and game are implemented as features within the LTLMoP toolkit for robot mission planning.},

  title={How Multirobot Systems Research will Accelerate our Understanding of Social Animal Behavior}, 
  year={2006},
  volume={94},
  number={7},
  pages={1445-1463},
  abstract={Our understanding of social insect behavior has significantly influenced artificial intelligence (AI) and multirobot systems' research (e.g., ant algorithms and swarm robotics). In this work, however, we focus on the opposite question: "How can multirobot systems research contribute to the understanding of social animal behavior?" As we show, we are able to contribute at several levels. First, using algorithms that originated in the robotics community, we can track animals under observation to provide essential quantitative data for animal behavior research. Second, by developing and applying algorithms originating in speech recognition and computer vision, we can automatically label the behavior of animals under observation. In some cases the automatic labeling is more accurate and consistent than manual behavior identification. Our ultimate goal, however, is to automatically create, from observation, executable models of behavior. An executable model is a control program for an agent that can run in simulation (or on a robot). The representation for these executable models is drawn from research in multirobot systems programming. In this paper we present the algorithms we have developed for tracking, recognizing, and learning models of social animal behavior, details of their implementation, and quantitative experimental results using them to study social insects},

We study and discuss the state of the art of simulation-based performance evaluation of IVC protocols and applications. In the scope of this article, we concentrate on the most recent advances and findings by outlining selected models, techniques, and issues that are specifically related to IVC, with a strong focus on aspects beyond network simulation issues. The main objective is to determine the degree to which available simulation techniques produce realistic results.},

  title={Behavior Comparison of Metal Oxide Arrester Blocks When Excited by VFTO and Lightning}, 
  year={2015},
  volume={57},
  number={6},
  pages={1608-1615},
  abstract={With the development of the ultrahigh voltage (UHV) and extra high voltage (EHV) electric power industry in China, gas insulated substation (GIS) is applied widely. Very fast transient overvoltage (VFTO) caused by disconnector operations in GIS may damage the insulation of equipment due to its high frequency and amplitude. As one of the main overvoltage protection equipments, the protection behavior of surge arresters has received extensive attention. In this paper, the residual voltage behavior, the impedance behavior, and the response behavior of five different representative arrester blocks when excited by VFTO and lightning are investigated, respectively. Experimental results present that when the current peak keeps constant, the residual voltage under VFTO is approximately 14.7%–18.2% higher than under the standard lightning impulse voltage (8/20 μs, LI). The arrester block presents different impedance behavior under VFTO and LI. It behaves dominantly inductively under LI and expresses an impedance converting behavior under VFTO. Furthermore, the diameter and the shape of arrester blocks have little impact on the ratio of $V_{0}$ to  $V_{{\rm 1mA}}$ under VFTO. Therefore, the protective effect of arresters varies slightly under VFTO and LI. Investigating behavior of arrester blocks under VFTO in comparison with under LI could be applied not only in VFTO simulation and insulation coordination but also in the design and the operating of metal oxide surge arrester in GIS.},

  year={2020},

  pages={4836-4849},
  abstract={Guidewire tracking is a clinical challenge in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The current practice of image-based and sensor-based tracking techniques is still limited by radiation exposure, contrast injection, device sterilization, and procedure safety. In this paper, an interventionalist-behavior-based data fusion framework is developed to provide a novel strategy for tracking guidewire motions in PCI. Four types of natural behavior were acquired from ten interventionalists while performing guidewire translation and rotation based on a simulation platform. Different numbers of behaviors are fused by a hierarchical framework with six local tracking models and three ensemble algorithms. After Gaussian mixture regression-based ensemble fusion, a three-behavior scheme can achieve average tracking errors of 1.07 ± 0.17 mm for guidewire translation, and 20.05 ± 3.36° for guidewire rotation. Relevant statistical analysis further reveals that this scheme outperforms the cases using fewer behaviors, and ensemble fusion brings significant error reduction compared with only local fusion. These meaningful results indicate the great potential of the proposed framework for promoting the improvement of guidewire tracking in PCI.},

  volume={1},
  number={4},
  pages={309-326},
  abstract={The generator of adaptive dilemma-based interactive narratives (GADIN) presented in this paper dynamically generates interactive narratives which are focused on dilemmas to create dramatic tension. The system is provided with knowledge of generic story actions and dilemmas based on those clichE¿s encountered in many storytelling domains. The domain designer is only required to provide domain-specific information, for example, regarding characters and their relationships, locations, and actions. A planner creates sequences of actions that all lead to a dilemma for a character (who can be the user). The user interacts with the storyworld by making decisions on relevant dilemmas and by freely choosing their own actions. Using this input, the system chooses and adapts future storylines according to the user's past behavior. Previous interactive narrative systems often have content creation and ordering requirements that restrict the possibility for sustaining the dramatic interest of the narrative over a long time period. In addition, many of these systems are not easily transferable between domains. In this paper, the GADIN system is demonstrated to both be able to maintain the dramatic interest of generated narratives over a long time period and to have a core architecture that is applicable to any domain.},

  abstract={As a complex system, crowd dynamics emerge bottom-up from the local interactions between pedestrians as component subsystems. This article proposes a predictive agent-based crowd simulation model to analyze the outcomes of emergency evacuation scenarios taking into account collisions between pedestrians, smoke, fire sprinklers, and exit indicators. The crowd model is based on a decentralized control system structure, where each pedestrian agent is governed through a deliberative-reactive control architecture. The simulation model for evacuation includes a routing-based control system for dynamic-guided evacuation. A design case illustrates the modeling process. Results show that the crowd simulation model based on agent autonomy and local interactions is able to generate higher level crowd dynamics through emergence.},

  abstract={An assumption behind new interface approaches that employ physical means of interaction is that these can leverage users’ prior knowledge from the real world, making them intuitive or ‘natural’ to use. This paper presents a user study of Tangible Augmented Reality, which shows that physical input tools can invite a wide variety of interaction behaviours and raise unmatched expectations about how to interact. Children played with interactive sequences in an augmented book using physical paddles to control the main characters. Our analysis focuses on how knowledge and skills that children have from the physical world succeed or fail to apply in the interaction with this application. We found that children expected the digital augmentations to behave and react analogous to physical 3D objects, encouraged by the ability to act in 3D space and the (digital) visual feedback. The affordances of the paddles as physical interaction devices invited actions that the system could not detect or interpret. In effect, children often struggled to understand what it was in their actions that made the system react.},

  year={2003},

  pages={629-643},
  abstract={The development of realistic computer-generated synthetic environments, also calleddistributed virtual environments, relies heavily upon computer-generated actors (CGAs) to provide accurate behaviors at reasonable cost so that the synthetic environments are useful, affordable, complex, and high fidelity. Unfortunately, the pace of synthetic environment development and the level of desired CGA performance continue to rise at a much faster rate than CGA capability improvements. This insatiable demand for realism in CGAs for synthetic environments arises from the growing understanding of the significant role that modeling and simulation can play in a variety of uses. These uses include training, analysis, procurement decisions, mission rehearsal, doctrine development, force-level and task-level training, information assurance, cyberwarfare, force structure analysis, sustainability analysis, life cycle costs analysis, material management, infrastructure analysis, and many other uses. In these and other uses of military synthetic environments, CGAs play a central role because they have the potential to increase the realism of the environment while also reducing the cost of operating the environment. The progress made in addressing the technical challenges that must be overcome to realize effective and realistic CGAs for military simulation environments and the technical areas that should be the focus of future work are the subject of this paper, which surveys the technologies and progress made in the construction and use of CGAs. In this, the third installment in the series of papers discussing CGAs, we conclude our discussion of CGA technologies by concluding the discussion of human behavior modeling for CGAs, and we present some suggested future research directions for CGA technologies.},
