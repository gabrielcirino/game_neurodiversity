  abstract={Distributed work is an increasingly common phenomenon in a number of technical and professional settings, and the complexity of this work requires high degrees of knowledge sharing and integration that move beyond assembly-line approaches to collaboration. Since participants in distributed-work settings rely almost exclusively on written and spoken language to mediate their collaborative relationships, professional communication faculty need educational approaches that empower students with language practices designed specifically to support effective teaming in these complex environments. To address this need, we employ discourse analysis and Speech Act Theory to identify these language practices in a case study of two cohorts of distributed, interdisciplinary, and cross-cultural student teams. The findings show correlations between language practices and successful collaboration. These correlations have significant implications for teaching and practice.},

  title={Influence of Gamification Elements on Explicit Motive Dispositions}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={10},
  number={},
  pages={118058-118071},
  abstract={Explicit motive dispositions are the psychological needs that drive the behavior and play a predictive role in the selection of the achievement goal. In the presence of situational incentive cues, the variables of explicit motive dispositions may arouse/suppress. Similar to these incentive cues, gamification elements (such as leaderboards, points, badges, etc.) offer motivational affordances that either increase or decrease performance and engagement depending on the agent’s perception. However, this similarity, and the effects of motivational affordances on the agent’s explicit motive disposition and the selection of subsequent achievement goals, have not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, the gamification elements (leaderboard and points) of the DRACO gamification system are redesigned to provoke explicit motive dispositions of the students. The results of the field study revealed that the experiment group had a significantly lower fear of failure and power motives (both hope and fear), fewer selections of performance-avoidance goals, and performed better based on theory exams and course grades compared to the control group. Consequently, it supports the hypothesis that gamification elements could provoke explicit motive dispositions and could affect the subsequent achievement goal selection, and the design of the gamification elements could be a determinant factor in this behavior change. Furthermore, this study contributes a systematic Spanish translation of the UMS-3 questionnaire.},

  title={An Interactive Model-Driven Simulation Approach for Dynamic Behavior Analysis in Armed Conflicts}, 
  year={2018},
  volume={6},
  number={},
  pages={36744-36756},
  abstract={As system dynamic behaviors are difficult to capture and analyze in model-based systems engineering, executable architectures, and simulation methods are widely studied to understand the behaviors that result from interactions amongst system components. However, most current studies often strive for analyzing independently specific aspects of architecture rather than capturing simultaneously the structural, behavioral, and performance related features, leading to failures of understanding the whole system from a global perspective. Accordingly, an interactive model-driven simulation that includes meta-model mapping and collaborative engine capabilities specific to DoDAF, Rhapsody, and STK simulations is first proposed to integrate the full advantages of different analytical tools. Then, a synergic engine is developed to provide synchronized control between time-driven and event-driven execution through the dynamic analysis process. Two executable techniques communicate with each other throughout the entire execution cycle to provide complementary necessary process information. The events occurred in the STK simulation scenario are used as the trigger of the executable state machine model that describes only the logical procedure of system behaviors without timeand space-related constraints. Last, an illustrative example of the Russian-Turkish Plane Incident is carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of the foregoing approach.},

  abstract={A simple computer-generated agent was developed of which four behavioral aspects could be altered. Emotional behavior was defined and simulated in terms of these aspects. Participants matched a list of six emotions to the animated emotional behavior of the agent. Results suggest that it is possible to identify emotions from a set of simulated modulation patterns. The successful simulation of a computer-generated “emotional” agent supports a behavioral theory of emotion. In addition, it reveals an almost overlooked aspect of emotion that may spark further research and shows the fertility of the approach known as “artificial life” for the field of psychology.},

  pages={555-562},
  abstract={Game-based assignments typically form an integral component of computer programming courses. The effectiveness of the assignments in motivating students to carry out repetitive programming tasks is somewhat limited since their outcomes are invariably limited to a simple win or loss scenario. Accordingly, this paper develops a simulation environment in which students can create a game strategy via programming for a challenging strategy-type game. After completion of the game, the environment provides the student with a set of metrics that provides helpful clues as to how the student might reprogram the strategy to improve the result. The provided metrics help to avoid a tedious trial-and-error refinement process and, therefore, greatly motivate the student to complete the assignment and achieve a better result. The simulation environment can be used in either a standalone mode or in an interactive mode in which the students compete against one another online. The competition element increases the motivation of the students to complete the task to the best of their ability.},

  year={2019},
  volume={7},
  number={},
  pages={13668-13682},
  abstract={The separating behavior defines the division of a crowd from a single flow into two distributary flows due to the different pedestrians' destinations. Nevertheless, in the existing literature on pedestrian flow, there is a lack of simulation research on the separating crowd behavior in a T-shaped channel. By conducting a series of controlled experiments, we analyzed the moving trajectories and the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of pedestrians in the separation process. Based on an analysis of the controlled experiments, we proposed an improved social force model that fully considers the characteristics of pedestrians' swapping locations, and refines the directions of pedestrians' expected speeds in three stages of the pedestrian separation process. During the simulation, we applied the improved model to explore the effects of the pedestrians' swapping locations on the macroscopic phenomena, microscopic individual behavior, and traffic efficiency within a T-shaped channel. The simulation results show that if pedestrians' swapping locations are concentrated in a certain area close to the entrance, the traffic efficiency in the T-shaped channel will be higher than that if the pedestrians' swapping locations are dispersed. Moreover, as the flow rate at the entrance increases, the swapping location becomes more concentrated closer to the entrance, the mean speed increases, and fewer conflicts occur between the pedestrians.},

  abstract={Simple rules, when executed by individual agents in a large group, or swarm, can lead to complex behaviors that are often difficult or impossible to predict knowing only the rules. However, aggregate behavior is not always unpredictable-even for swarm models said to be beyond analysis. For the class of swarming algorithms examined herein, we analytically identify several possible emergent behaviors and their underlying causes: clustering, drifting, and explosion. They also analyze the likelihood of these behaviors emerging from randomly selected swarm configurations and present a few examples. The analytic results are illustrated via simulation},

  abstract={This study examines gender and country differences with respect to a range of gaming motivations (e.g., social, performance, habit) and game genre choices (e.g., action, sports, casual). Surveys were conducted with 634 university students from Singapore, Germany, and the United States. Overall, the findings suggest that many game motivations and genre choices differed by player gender, country, and the interaction between gender and country in some cases. Further, game motivations and genre choices were related to each other, though sometimes in a negative direction. Finally, differences in gaming motivations, genre choices, and gender, but not the country of residence, were all found to relate to differences in future intention to play. Although these topics have been studied in isolation in previous research, the present study contributes unique insights about the intersections of gender, cultural background, gaming motivations, and genre choices.},

  abstract={Over the past two decades, crowdsourcing activities have expanded considerably. More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has radically changed the way people live and work, and the way organizations do business. So far, not many studies have analyzed if and to what extent trustworthiness can influence the admiration to practice crowdsourcing and could reward financial benefits in the COVID-19 period. Against this background, in this article, the aim is to investigate the influence of crowdfunding trustworthiness and financial rewards on the success of crowdsourcing activities. The analysis is made more complete by including technology leadership support as a moderator. With the help of the existing literature and theories, a research model has been developed conceptually, which was later validated using the partial least square-structural equation modeling technique on a sample of 319 responses from participants based in Europe and Asia. The study found that lucidity, gamification, exposure, and coordination along with financial rewards positively influence admiration for crowdsourcing, which, in turn, positively impacts successful crowdsourcing practices in the COVID-19 period. The study also shows that there is a significant moderating impact of technological leadership support on successful crowdsourcing practices in the COVID-19 period.},

  abstract={Video game testing has become a major investment of time, labor, and expense in the game industry. Particularly the balancing of in-game units, characters, and classes can cause long-lasting issues that persist years after a game's launch. While approaches incorporating artificial intelligence have already shown successes in reducing manual effort and enhancing game development processes, most of these draw on heuristic, generalized, or optimal behavior routines, while actual low-level decisions from individual players and their resulting playing styles are rarely considered. In this article, we apply deep player behavior modeling to turn atomic actions of 213 players from six months of single-player instances within the MMORPG Aion into generative models that capture and reproduce particular playing strategies. In a subsequent simulation, the resulting generative agents (“replicants”) were tested against common NPC opponent types of MMORPGs that iteratively increased in difficulty, respective to the primary factor that constitutes this enemy type (Melee, Ranged, Rogue, Buffer, Debuffer, Healer, Tank, or Group). As a result, imbalances between classes as well as strengths and weaknesses regarding particular combat challenges could be identified and regulated automatically.},

  abstract={Rehabilitation robots have the potential to alleviate the global burden of neurorehabilitation. Robot-based multiplayer gaming with virtual and haptic interaction may improve motivation, engagement, and implicit learning in robotic therapy. Over the past few years, there has been growing interest in robot mediated haptic dyads, or human-robot-robot-human interaction. The effect of such a paradigm on motor learning in general and specifically for individuals with motor and/or cognitive impairments is an open area of research. We reviewed the literature to investigate the effect of a robot-based haptic dyad on motor learning. Thirty-eight articles met the inclusion criteria for this review. We summarize study characteristics including device, haptic rendering, and experimental task. Our main findings indicate that dyadic training's impact on motor learning is inconsistent in that some studies show significant improvement of motor training while others show no influence. We also find that the relative skill level of the partner and interaction characteristics such as stiffness of connection and availability of visual information influence motor learning outcomes. We discuss implications for neurorehabilitation and conclude that additional research is needed to determine optimal interaction characteristics for motor learning and to extend this research to individuals with cognitive and motor impairments.},

  abstract={Educational institutions have been adopting business simulation games as a resource for developing skills and competencies. However, the real-time study of aspects related to learning during their use still needs to further investigation. This work aims to present contributions of a new methodology that considers the analysis of the player’s experience from the physiological, behavioural, and psychological perspectives, supported by biometric devices. Its validation was based on data collection conducted at a university in Brazil, with ten participants during a game monitored by Electroencephalogram and Eye Tracking technologies, relating the behaviour of the cerebral cortex with areas of greater interest and gaze fixation of the players. Additionally, pre-and post-test questionnaires highlighted personal behaviours and collective patterns influenced by aspects such as tutorial and game design elements, prior knowledge, ergonomic issues, cognitive strategy definition, organization of executive functions, and memory formation. The results show that the proposed model can be beneficial in assessing the potential of this type of organizational environment simulation, both for those who use it in the teaching process and for serious game developers.},

The presented mechanical model allows simulating the conductors' service life from manufacturing to operating conditions by describing the evolution of strains and stresses within each individual strand. The distributions of axial strains within strands, obtained from simulation results of both thermal and Lorentz loadings, could help characterize the influence of design parameters.},

  abstract={Today, there is a great variety of learning techniques and methodologies: traditional lectures, role-plays, group dynamics, project-based learning, simulations, educational games, and so on. Regarding technology-enhanced learning, the educational usage of virtual reality is innovative and the initiatives carried out suggest that this technology is an appealing medium for young people that facilitates an active and effective teaching. On the other hand, agile methodologies are widely spread across the IT industry and it is necessary to look for the best techniques to learn them in the most appropriate way. This contribution presents a virtual reality serious video game, named ScrumVR, which aims to teach the key aspects of the most widespread agile methodology for software development: Scrum. To do so, this video game tries to gets players closer to their first weeks of work within a Scrum team. The empirical results, gathered through a case study conducted with 78 software engineering students and supported by instruments, such as prepost tests and questionnaires, indicate that ScrumVR facilitates the learning of the roles, meetings, artifacts, and practices employed in Scrum, and contributes to enhance student's motivation and the whole learning experience.},

  year={2025},
  volume={13},
  number={},
  pages={46865-46880},
  abstract={Computational neuroscience relies on complex mathematical models to simulate brain activity and decipher underlying biological processes. However, these simulations are computationally intensive, prompting the exploration of high-performance computing systems as a viable solution to enhance efficiency. In this work, we introduce SimHH, an extended-Hodgkin-Huxley simulator designed for versatility and high performance. Leveraging the OpenMPI library, SimHH exhibits exceptional scalability, catering to a wide spectrum of computing environments. Scalability is optimized through two distinct configurations: one that distributes all possible cell-compartment potentials among network nodes and another that shares compartment potentials only among relevant nodes, employing MPI Allgather and Alltoall. Seamless support for CUDA, CUDA-aware MPI, and NVLink further enhances performance, with communication overhead minimized through concurrent execution of compute kernels. Benchmarking against various neuron models, including the challenging Inferior-Olivary Nucleus, demonstrates SimHH’s potential, achieving remarkable results on up to 256 compute nodes. Notably, large-scale GPU clusters enable the simulation of highly biologically plausible networks exceeding 10 million cells. Comparative analyses against CPU- and FPGA-based solutions underscore SimHH’s superiority, boasting a speedup of approximately  $150\times $  over single-threaded CPU implementations,  $10\times $  over single-FPGA setups, and  $10\times $  over multi-threaded CPU configurations with 128 threads, all for a fully connected network of approximately 7,000 IO cells. Additionally, a  $7\times $  speedup is attained compared to the established NEST neurosimulator running on 32 nodes, simulating a network of 94,720 Hodgkin-Huxley neurons with gap junctions. These findings underscore SimHH’s efficacy in advancing computational-neuroscience research by facilitating efficient and scalable simulation of complex neuronal networks.},

  year={2015},
  volume={45},
  number={2},
  pages={253-265},
  abstract={In real-life manual control tasks, human controllers are often required to follow a visible and predictable reference signal, enabling them to use feedforward control actions in conjunction with feedback actions that compensate for errors. Little is known about human control behavior in these situations. This paper investigates how humans adapt their feedforward control dynamics to the controlled element dynamics in a combined ramp-tracking and disturbance-rejection task. A human-in-the-loop experiment is performed with a pursuit display and vehicle-like controlled elements, ranging from a single integrator through second-order systems with a break frequency at either 3, 2, or 1 rad/s, to a double integrator. Because the potential benefits of feedforward control increase with steeper ramp segments in the target signal, three steepness levels are tested to investigate their possible effect on feedforward control with the various controlled elements. Analyses with four novel models of the operator, fitted to time-domain data, reveal feedforward control for all tested controlled elements and both (nonzero) tested levels of ramp steepness. For the range of controlled element dynamics investigated, it is found that humans adapt to these dynamics in their feedforward response, with a close to perfect inversion of the controlled element dynamics. No significant effects of ramp steepness on the feedforward model parameters are found.},

  abstract={The primary factors that impact food safety are the quality and safety of agricultural products. The quality and safety of agricultural products are closely related to farmers’ decision-making behavior. In addition, the decision-making behavior of the government and consumers is the key factor of farmers’ decision-making behavior. The study explores the ideal state among the government, farmers and consumers to promote the improvement of the quality of agricultural products, thereby contributing to food safety. The study includes the government, farmers and consumers in an evolutionary game model to explore game relationships and evolution paths of decision making among the three stakeholders. The dynamic analysis of the decision replication, the stability analysis of strategy evolution, and the numerical simulation experiment verify the following: the evolutionary process of the decision-making behavior of the three stakeholders to an ideal state is affected by many factors, and the value ranges of the different factors have different impacts on the convergence speed of the three stakeholders to an ideal state; When certain conditions are met, the decision-making behaviors of the three stakeholders can evolve to an ideal state, and effective government supervision can promote the transformation of farmers from nongreen to green pesticide application behavior, and encourage consumers to purchase high-quality agricultural products.},

  title={An integrated incentive framework for mobile crowdsourced sensing},

  volume={21},

  pages={146-156},
  abstract={Currently, mobile devices (e.g., smartphones) are equipped with multiple wireless interfaces and rich builtin functional sensors that possess powerful computation and communication capabilities, and enable numerous Mobile Crowdsourced Sensing (MCS) applications. Generally, an MCS system is composed of three components: a publisher of sensing tasks, crowd participants who complete the crowdsourced tasks for some kinds of rewards, and the crowdsourcing platform that facilitates the interaction between publishers and crowd participants. Incentives are a fundamental issue in MCS. This paper proposes an integrated incentive framework for MCS, which appropriately utilizes three widely used incentive methods: reverse auction, gamification, and reputation updating. Firstly, a reverse-auction-based two-round participant selection mechanism is proposed to incentivize crowds to actively participate and provide high-quality sensing data. Secondly, in order to avoid untruthful publisher feedback about sensing-data quality, a gamification-based verification mechanism is designed to evaluate the truthfulness of the publisher's feedback. Finally, the platform updates the reputation of both participants and publishers based on their corresponding behaviors.

  abstract={Game-based learning (GBL) has long been recognized as an effective way to engage students in learning through games, but little emphasis has been placed on scaffolding support for students, which hinders their learning. Therefore, our design of Space Adventure GBL ties games closely to scaffolds at every stage and investigates what role games and scaffolds play and whether greater exposure to games and scaffolds can boost learning. Six classes of 152 8th graders were randomly assigned to unlimited gaming and scaffolding group, limited scaffolding group, and limited gaming group. Students' learning outcomes in physics are optimized when they have unlimited access to GBL's gaming and scaffolding. All three groups perceived similar levels of engagement, engrossment, and total immersion. According to regression, time spent mastering the scaffolds on their first attempt is the most determinant predictor of physics concept learning and engagement, whereas winning the games for the first-time predicts mental model construction, engrossment, and total immersion the most. This study sheds light on future GBL studies that closely tying scaffolds and games challenges could motivate and facilitate students to master scaffolds and win games on their first attempts, resulting in better physics learning performance and more game immersion.},

  abstract={The objective of this study was to demonstrate the utility of an established model of human motor behavior for assessing the fidelity of a virtual reality (VR) and haptic-based simulation for fine motor task performance. This study was also to serve as a basis for formulating general performance-based simulator-design guidelines toward balancing perceived realism with simulator limitations, such as latency resulting from graphic and haptic renderings. A low-fidelity surgical simulator was developed as an example VR for study, and user performance was tested in a simplified tissue-cutting task using a virtual scalpel. The observed aspect of the simulation included a discrete-movement task under different system-lag conditions and settings of task difficulty. Results revealed user performance in the VR to conform with Fitts' law of motor behavior and for performance to degrade with increasing task difficulty and system time lag. In general, the findings of this work support predictions on human performance under various simulator-design conditions using an established model of motor-control behavior and formulation of human-performance-based simulator-design principles.},

  year={2022},
  volume={34},
  number={5},
  pages={729-747},
  abstract={Motivation is an important feature of emotion. By driving approach to positive events and promoting avoidance of negative stimuli, motivation drives adaptive actions and goal pursuit. The amygdala has been associated with a variety of affective processes, particularly the appraisal of stimulus valence that is assumed to play a crucial role in the generation of approach and avoidance behaviors. Here, we measured amygdala functional connectivity patterns while participants played a video game manipulating goal conduciveness through the presence of good, neutral, or bad monsters. As expected, good versus bad monsters elicited opposing motivated behaviors, whereby good monsters induced more approach and bad monsters triggered more avoidance. These opposing directional behaviors were paralleled by increased connectivity between the amygdala and medial brain areas, such as the OFC and posterior cingulate, for good relative to bad, and between amygdala and caudate for bad relative to good monsters. Moreover, in both conditions, individual connectivity strength between the amygdala and medial prefrontal regions was positively correlated with brain scores from a latent component representing efficient goal pursuit, which was identified by a partial least squares analysis determining the multivariate association between amygdala connectivity and behavioral motivation indices during gameplay. At the brain level, this latent component highlighted a widespread pattern of amygdala connectivity, including a dorsal frontoparietal network and motor areas. These results suggest that amygdala-medial prefrontal interactions captured the overall subjective relevance of ongoing events, which could consecutively drive the engagement of attentional, executive, and motor circuits necessary for implementing successful goal-pursuit, irrespective of approach or avoidance directions.},

  abstract={The ability to simulate realistic crowds is a highly sought-after capability in the fields of entertainment (video games, movies), urban planning and evacuation simulations. Traditional approaches to crowd simulation rely on heavy Central Processing Unit (CPU) computation. This approach has limitations in terms of scalability and performance, which are solvable with the use of Graphics Programming Units (GPUs) and parallel computing techniques. In fact, the development of Compute Shaders on GPU allows the execution of general-purpose operations alongside traditional rendering tasks within real-time applications. This paper aims to contribute to the current literature on crowd simulation methods by developing a real-time simulation model that integrates and expands several techniques from literature, adapted and optimized to exploit GPU computing capabilities. The proposed model incorporates continuous representations for crowds in order to simulate human movement and decision-making. The achieved results demonstrate a high level of scalability and efficiency. The implemented techniques and optimizations allow the model to handle a significant number of agents while maintaining real-time performances to achieve reduced simulation time and good user experience. Stress tests showcase that the proposed model significantly outperforms other macroscopic models, maintaining a stable frame rate of 60 FPS when simulating 20,000 agents even on mid-range systems intended for personal use.},

  volume={7},

  pages={513-527},
  abstract={ This paper describes a microscopic model that is able to simulate traffic situations in an urban environment in real time for use in driving simulators. Two types of vehicles are considered in the simulation, namely the user-driven vehicle at the center of the simulation model and the other vehicles that interact with it and its surroundings, which configure the developed traffic model. Simulation is performed in a reduced zone, called the control zone, surrounding the user-driven vehicle. This control zone is a mobile zone centered on the user-driven vehicle. The size of the control zone depends on the maximum number of vehicles involved simultaneously, the traffic density, and the driver's limit of visibility. The other vehicles involved in the traffic simulation are created or destroyed within the limits of the control zone. The general behavior of the traffic model is based on the following theory. Vehicles have an associated driver model that establishes several control functions for them to follow the path, while the steering, acceleration, and braking maneuvers follow certain models of behavior. A traffic light regulation is also included but only in the control area. The possibility of introducing anomalous traffic situations into the simulation is also considered, such as the presence of obstacles, abnormal maneuvers, etc. The developed model is immediately applicable to large-scale driving simulators for driver training, traffic control studies, and safety studies. },

  pages={31-44},
  abstract={Immediate rewards are usually very sparse in the real world, which brings a great challenge to plain learning methods. Inspired by the fact that emotional reactions are incorporated into the computation of subjective value during decision-making in humans, an emotion-motivated decision-making framework is proposed in this article. Specifically, we first build a brain-inspired computational model of amygdala–hippocampus interaction to generate emotional reactions. The intrinsic emotion derives from the external reward and episodic memory and represents three psychological states: 1) valence; 2) novelty; and 3) motivational relevance. Then, a model-based (MB) decision-making approach with emotional intrinsic rewards is proposed to solve the continuous control problem of mobile robots. This method can execute online MB control with the constraint of the model-free policy and global value function, which is conducive to getting a better solution with a faster policy search. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach has higher learning efficiency and maintains a higher level of exploration, especially, in some very sparse-reward environments.},

  abstract={Social and ubiquitous computing opens up many opportunities to engage citizens in activities that benefit their communities. Technology is ready and available, but there are still open issues concerning how to engage people in activities that are not extrinsically rewarding or whose impact is not immediately perceived. In this paper, we explore the role that situated motivational affordances can play in encouraging citizens in one of such activities, early warning. With this purpose, we designed and implemented a gamified app, IWarn that was iteratively designed following an action-research process to align the needs and capabilities of two types of stakeholders: emergency managers and citizens. The situated motivational affordances framework was used to lead the evaluation considering the motivational affordances enabled by the app and the situation in which it was used. The IWarn app was evaluated in an in-the-wild deployment where 4 emergency workers and 17 citizens took part in a real exercise for one week. Our results suggest that the gamified elements helped to improve intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and user engagement. This work contributes to the social computing domain by illustrating a use case where carefully designed gamification can help in engaging citizens in participatory processes},

  pages={77-93},
  abstract={A grand challenge in the field of artificial life is to find a general theory of emergent self-organizing systems. In swarm systems most of the observed complexity is based on motion of simple entities. Similarly, statistical mechanics focuses on collective properties induced by the motion of many interacting particles. In this article we apply methods from statistical mechanics to swarm systems. We try to explain the emergent behavior of a simulated swarm by applying methods based on the fluctuation theorem. Empirical results indicate that swarms are able to produce negative entropy within an isolated subsystem due to frozen accidents. Individuals of a swarm are able to locally detect fluctuations of the global entropy measure and store them, if they are negative entropy productions. By accumulating these stored fluctuations over time the swarm as a whole is producing negative entropy and the system ends up in an ordered state. We claim that this indicates the existence of an inverted fluctuation theorem for emergent self-organizing dissipative systems. This approach bears the potential of general applicability.},

  abstract={To improve the hybrid augmented intelligence of a human-in-the-loop (HiTL) control system, it is desirable to investigate the issue of human behavior learning (HBL), i.e., empower the machine to understand how a human expert performs a manipulation task. The human expert is commonly modeled as an optimal controller with unknown weighting matrices that depict the tradeoff between different control objectives. Therefore, the goal of this article is to determine the weighting matrices of the human objective function with fast convergence rate, which is usually pursued to achieve better efficiency and performance in practice. Accordingly, for a class of HiTL system, we propose a novel adaptive inverse optimal control (IOC) approach for online learning human behavior with a fixed-time guarantee. Our proposed method consists of two parts. In the first step, a dynamic regressor extension and mixing (DREM)-based estimation method is used for online learning of the human feedback gain with fixed-time convergence using the demonstrated system state measurement only. Then, with the estimated human feedback gain, a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem is solved to determine the weighting matrices of the human objective function. The simulation and the experiment on a steering control have validated the effectiveness and applicability of the developed approach.},

  abstract={In this article, the issue of human behavior learning (HBL) is addressed for a class of nonlinear human-in-the-loop (HiTL) systems where the human operator is viewed as a nonlinear optimal controller. Owing to its outstanding interpretability and strong nonlinear representation capability, the Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy model is employed to represent the nonlinear HiTL control system and approximate the unknown human control law based on the parallel distributed compensation (PDC) scheme. A quadratic-like cost function with fuzzy weighting matrices is built to depict the human behavior, which conforms to human thinking and is unknown to the machine. The aim of the HBL is to retrieve the fuzzy weighting matrices such that the human control law will be optimal in the sense of minimizing the retrieved cost function. In the proposed HBL scheme, the state-dependent Riccati equation-based nonlinear optimal control technique plays an important role, which has a similar structure to the linear quadratic regulator theory and thus is of low computational complexity. With the help of the PDC-based fuzzy approximator for the unknown human control law, a two-step procedure is proposed for the HBL. First, a filter-based adaptive law is developed to learn the gain matrices of the fuzzy approximator using the system state data only. The convergence analysis of the adaptive estimator is also given. Then, a semidefinite programming problem with the quadratic objective function can be set up for determining the fuzzy weighting matrices of the cost function. The simulation study on a steering control system of the intelligent vehicle is given to show the effectiveness and applicability of the developed approach.},

  abstract={In a recent article by Borg and Channon it was shown that social information alone, decoupled from any within-lifetime learning, can result in improved performance on a food-foraging task compared to when social information is unavailable. Here we assess whether access to social information leads to significant behavioral differences both when access to social information leads to improved performance on the task, and when it does not: Do any behaviors resulting from social information use, such as movement and increased agent interaction, persist even when the ability to discriminate between poisonous and non-poisonous food is no better than when social information is unavailable? Using a neuroevolutionary artificial life simulation, we show that social information use can lead to the emergence of behaviors that differ from when social information is unavailable, and that these behaviors act as a promoter of agent interaction. The results presented here suggest that the introduction of social information is sufficient, even when decoupled from within-lifetime learning, for the emergence of pro-social behaviors. We believe this work to be the first use of an artificial evolutionary system to explore the behavioral consequences of social information use in the absence of within-lifetime learning.},

  abstract={The cyber-physical-social (CPS) computing and networking is a human centric and holistic computing framework which needs to convert the low-level data of physical, cyber, and social worlds into higher level information which can provide insights and help humans make complex decisions. Here, we focus on human fishing behavior recognition for vessel monitoring systems (VMS), an application of CPS. And the recognition of fishing behavior is the key task for studying human fishing activities, monitoring illegal fishing, and protecting fishery resources. However, VMS data basically consist of sequentially recorded position information and do not directly indicate whether a fisherman is fishing or not; thus, converting these low-level CPS data into intuitive information to humans is the primary task. In this paper, an identification model based on multi-step clustering algorithm (MSC-FBI) is proposed to automatically learn and discover fishing behaviors at sea. First, a temporal-spatial distance model is established; then, an improved multi-step clustering algorithm is used to identify human fishing behaviors, and finally, the patterns of different behaviors are extracted from the trajectory, and the unsupervised behavior learning model is established. Using this method, many experiments on different fishing trajectory data were implemented and compared with a traditional identification method based on the Gaussian mixture model (GMM-FBI). The experimental results illustrate the proposed model’s superior performance.},

Three-dimensional motion data of full-body movements are obtained from RGB-D sensors and used to recognize emotions by means of linear SVMs. Ten children diagnosed with High Functioning Autism or Asperger Syndrome were involved in the evaluation phase, consisting of repeated sessions to play a specifically designed serious game. Results from the evaluation study show an increase of tasks accuracy from the beginning to the end of training sessions in the trained group. In particular, while the increase of recognition accuracy was concentrated in the first sessions of the game, the increase for expression accuracy is more gradual throughout all sessions. Moreover, the training seems to produce a transfer effect on facial expression recognition.},

  abstract={Efficient exploration remains a challenging problem in reinforcement learning, especially for tasks where extrinsic rewards from environments are sparse or even totally disregarded. Significant advances based on intrinsic motivation show promising results in simple environments but often get stuck in environments with multimodal and stochastic dynamics. In this work, we propose a variational dynamic model based on the conditional variational inference to model the multimodality and stochasticity. We consider the environmental state–action transition as a conditional generative process by generating the next-state prediction under the condition of the current state, action, and latent variable, which provides a better understanding of the dynamics and leads to a better performance in exploration. We derive an upper bound of the negative log likelihood of the environmental transition and use such an upper bound as the intrinsic reward for exploration, which allows the agent to learn skills by self-supervised exploration without observing extrinsic rewards. We evaluate the proposed method on several image-based simulation tasks and a real robotic manipulating task. Our method outperforms several state-of-the-art environment model-based exploration approaches.},

The design task was constructed to be straightforward and uses a simplified environment as a probe for understanding the utility of gamification and the performance of collaboration. Single-player and multiplayer designs outperformed both optimization and expert-sourced designs of the same environment and multiplayer designs further outperformed the single-player designs. Single-player and multiplayer iterations followed linear and exponential decrease trends in total egress time, respectively. Our experiments provide strong evidence toward an interesting novel approach of crowdsourcing collaborative environment design.},

The implemented human operator model combines an ON-OFF control model and a behavior-based hybrid automaton with three controllers. The controllers, defined as continuous, discrete, and fine-tuning behavior, simulate the user's conceptual model of the user interface. The device model used is that of a commercial syringe pump with chevron keys, described as a formal specification. Results of the human operator model simulation were generated for 20 different numbers obtained from syringe pump log files. The simulation results were compared over 33 trials to a lab study employing a device based on the formal specification. The result of the simulation shows a significant similarity to the result of the lab study for all the numbers used.},

  abstract={In Cognitive Radio (CR) networks, there is a common assumption that secondary devices always obey commands and are under full control. However, this assumption may become unrealistic for future CR networks with more intelligent, sophisticated and autonomous devices. Imperfect spectrum sensing and illegal behaviour of secondary users can result in harmful interference to primary users. In this paper, we propose a novel concept of Proactive-Optimization CR (POCR) networks, in which highly intelligent secondary users always try to proactively consider potentially harmful interference when making their behaviour decision. Furthermore, we propose an optimal transmission behaviour decision scheme for secondary users in POCR networks considering the possible harmful interference and penalties from primary users. Specifically, we formulate the system as a Partially-Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) problem. With this formulation, a low-complexity dynamic programming framework is presented to obtain the optimal behaviour policy. Extensive simulation results are presented to illustrate the significant performance improvement of the proposed scheme compared with the existing one that ignores the proactive-optimization of secondary users.},

  abstract={Health-related behaviors are among the most significant determinants of health and quality of life. Improving health behavior is an effective way to enhance health outcomes and mitigate the escalating challenges arising from an increasingly aging population and the proliferation of chronic diseases. Although it has been difficult to obtain lasting improvements in health behaviors on a wide scale, advances at the intersection of technology and behavioral science may provide the tools to address this challenge. In this paper, we describe a vision and an approach to improve health behavior interventions using the tools of behavioral informatics, an emerging transdisciplinary research domain based on system-theoretic principles in combination with behavioral science and information technology. The field of behavioral informatics has the potential to optimize interventions through monitoring, assessing, and modeling behavior in support of providing tailored and timely interventions. We describe the components of a closed-loop system for health interventions. These components range from fine grain sensor characterizations to individual-based models of behavior change. We provide an example of a research health coaching platform that incorporates a closed-loop intervention based on these multiscale models. Using this early prototype, we illustrate how the optimized and personalized methodology and technology can support self-management and remote care. We note that despite the existing examples of research projects and our platform, significant future research is required to convert this vision to full-scale implementations.},

  abstract={Few crowd simulation algorithms take collective group features such as group formations into consideration. Recent approaches often manually specify hard constraints such as predefined keyframe agent formations and interpolate them during the simulation. A proposed interactive, scalable framework generates freestyle group formations and transitions via natural and flexible sketching interaction. It automatically computes a plausible agent distribution in the target formation and agent correspondences between keyframes. In addition, two-level formation trajectory control lets users intuitively guide agents' transition paths from the initial formation to the target formation. In experiments, the framework efficiently generated formations on the fly while providing sufficiently flexible control to users.},

  abstract={Pervasive learning is a branch of mobile learning with an emphasis on context-awareness. Pervasive learning spaces (PLSs) create bridges from the real world to the virtual world, allowing the context-sensitive utilization of real-world objects and information in the learning process. Thus far, no model of technology integration for PLSs exists. We present a three-year process during which several game-based PLSs were developed. Based on the development experiences and a series of literature analyses, we present a technology integration model for game-based PLSs. The model meets the requirements of context, pedagogy, and game-design with technology. From these requirements, we derive three critical factors for technology integration in PLSs: 1) context-awareness, 2) available resources, and 3) unobtrusiveness of the technology. The model is discussed and evaluated through applying the model to the development process of LieksaMyst, a game-based PLS for a museum. User perceptions and usability of our games are also evaluated. The model can be utilized by PLS designers and developers for determining which requirements must be considered when integrating technology into a PLS. While the foundations of a technology integration model are now laid, work remains to be done in identifying development and evaluation methods based on the model.},

  pages={598-609},
  abstract={An emerging serious game (SG) is a game designed and developed from an objective other than pure fun, so that the player can learn while playing, but where the game unfolds spontaneously, autonomously, and without explicit laws, adapting to the player. On the other hand, an emerging serious game engine (ESGE) must make explicit the possibility of emergence in an SG, from the coordinated handling of the game plot, adapted to the specific educational context where it is being used. In previous articles, an ESGE has been proposed, which allows the initial emergence of an SG. This article defines a new component of the ESGE, called the plot adaptive system (PAS), which allows the updating of an SG according to the theme that is being given in a smart classroom (SaCI). This component is based on an ant colony optimization algorithm that changes the plots/frames in the game to follow the desired theme in the SaCI. Thus, this new component manages a set of game plots that may be of interest in an educational context to dynamically modify an SG initially conceived for a subject taught in the SaCI, in order to adequate it to the current pedagogical context. The novelty of the approach is that it adapts the SG to the educational context where it takes place. Additionally, this article analyzes the behavior of the PAS in a case study, and presents three experiments with very encouraging results.},

  abstract={In this article, we investigate the value of gaze-driven adaptive interventions to support the processing of textual documents with embedded visualizations, i.e., Magazine Style Narrative Visualizations (MSNVs). These interventions are provided dynamically by highlighting relevant data points in the visualization when the user reads related sentences in the MSNV text, as detected by an eye-tracker. We conducted a user study during which participants read a set of MSNVs with our interventions, and compared their performance and experience with participants who received no interventions. Our work extends previous findings by showing that dynamic, gaze-driven interventions can be delivered based on reading behaviors in MSNVs, a widespread form of documents that have never been considered for gaze-driven adaptation so far. Next, we found that the interventions significantly improved the performance of users with low levels of visualization literacy, i.e., those users who need help the most due to their lower ability to process and understand data visualizations. However, high literacy users were not impacted by the interventions, providing initial evidence that gaze-driven interventions can be further improved by personalizing them to the levels of visualization literacy of their users.},

  abstract={Virtual reality is just emerging as an accepted scientific discipline for medicine. The majority of near-term applications are in the area of surgical planning, interoperative navigation, and surgical simulations. Its use in rehabilitative medicine and psychiatry has made significant progress. The immediate future holds promise for virtual endoscopy, which may replace standard endoscopic procedures for diagnostic screening. Viewing of these virtual images may be with head-mounted displays or true suspended holograms. The most highly developed area is in surgical simulations. Current generations are approaching photorealistic representation of the anatomy, while measurement science is providing physical tissue properties and physiologic parameters. The types of simulations range from "needle-based" procedures, such as standard intravenous insertion, central venous placement catheter, and chest-tube insertion to more sophisticated simulations of full surgical procedures like laparoscopic cholecystectomy or hysteroscopic resection of interuterine myoma. In addition, haptic input devices are providing the sense of touch to the procedures. Soon there will be patient-specific models derived from computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans that will permit a surgeon to practice a delicate surgical procedure on the patient's specific virtual anatomy before actually performing the procedure on the patient.},

  abstract={In practice, product design decisions in a buyer-supplier setting can be either centralized or decentralized. Yet, it is unclear in what circumstances either of these settings can result in higher new product performance. In this study, we show that the choice of the level of centralization of product design decisions should be made contingent to the product complexity and behavioral factors of project managers involved in the decisions. In particular, we examine the influence of the cognitive ability, resistance to change, and cognitive effort of the project managers on the choice of the level of centralization of product design decisions. A methodology coming from complexity science is adopted and a simulation analysis is carried out. Results confirm that product complexity affects the relationship between the level of centralization of the product design decisions and product performance. Furthermore, we show that the benefit of centralized product design decisions is influenced by the level of cognitive effort, cognitive ability, and resistance to change of project managers. The analysis is performed in two different contexts characterized by varying levels of trust between the buyer and supplier. We discuss the implications of our findings for theory and practice.},

  abstract={Training sensory discrimination of the skin has the potential to reduce chronic pain due to sensorimotor impairments and increase sensorimotor function. Currently, there is no such device that can systematically provide rich skin stimulation suitable for a training protocol for individuals with amputation or major sensory impairment. This study describes the development and validation of a non-invasive wearable device meant to repeatedly and safely deliver somatosensory stimulations. The development was guided by a structured design control process to ensure the verifiability and validity of the design outcomes. Two sub-systems were designed: 1) a tactile display for touch and vibration sensations, and 2) a set of bands for sliding, pressure, and strain sensations. The device was designed with a versatile structure that allows for its application on different body parts. We designed a device-paired interactive computer program to enable structured sensory training sessions. Validation was performed with 11 individuals with intact limbs whose upper arm tactile sensitivity was measured over 5 training sessions. Tactile discrimination and perception threshold were measured using the standard 2-point discrimination and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament tests, respectively. The results of the monofilament test showed a significant improvement (p = 0.011), but the improvement was not significant for the 2-point discrimination test(p = 0.141). These promising results confirm the potential of the proposed training to increase the sensory acuity in the upper arms of individuals with intact limbs. Further studies will be conducted to determine how to transfer the findings of this work to improve the pain and/or functional rehabilitation in individuals with sensorimotor impairments.},

  abstract={Providing drivers with speed advisories is an effective eco-driving method at signalized intersections. However, all current research on speed advisory models has excluded the driver's behavior factor. In this paper, we focus on developing a speed advisory model that is able to adapt to the driver's behavior for eco-driving. First, we propose a closed-loop speed advisory framework, with simulation results to show that the current model could not fit in the closed-loop implementation. Next, the continuous acceleration with explicit high velocity boundary (CAEHV) model is established to address the issues when the existing model is used. However, the simulation results for the CAEHV model are not fully satisfactory due to the existence of oscillations in actual speed trajectories. Third, the CAEHV with coasting (CAEHV-C) model is established, in which the vehicle coasting is applied to supplement cruising to avoid oscillations. Simulation results show that the fuel economy performance of the CAEHV-C model is improved by 4% when compared with the CAEHV model. It also shows that CAEHV-C performs the best in terms of the driver's behavior adaptability.},

  pages={151531-151566},
  abstract={In recent years, autonomous vehicles (AVs), which observe the driving environment and lead a few or all of the driving tasks, have garnered tremendous success. The field of AVs has been rapidly developing and has found many applications. As a safety requirement established by policymakers, these vehicles must be evaluated before their deployment. The evaluation process for AVs is challenging because crashes are rare events, and AVs can escape passing predefined test scenarios. Therefore, capturing crashes and creating real test scenarios should be considered in order to develop an evaluation approach that represents real-world scenarios. One evaluation approach is based on the naturalistic field operational test (N-FOT), in which prototype AVs are driven on roads by volunteers or test engineers. Unfortunately, this approach is time-consuming and costly because thousands of miles need to be driven to experience a police-reported collision and nearly millions of miles for a fatal crash. Another approach is the accelerated evaluation method. The core idea of the accelerated evaluation approach is to modify the statistics of naturalistic driving so that safety-critical events are emphasized. This paper presents a brief survey of the advances that have occurred in the area of the evaluation of partially or fully autonomous vehicles, starting with naturalistic field operational tests (N-FOTs). The review covers the test matrix evaluation, worst-case scenario evaluation (WCSE), Monte Carlo simulations, and accelerated evaluation (AE). We also present all the simulation-based and agent-based modeling approaches that do not follow any evaluation protocol listed above. This study provides a scientific analysis of each evaluation techniques, focusing on their advantages/disadvantages, inherent restrictions, practicability, and optimality. The results reveal that the accelerated evaluation approach outperforms naturalistic field operational tests (N-FOTs), test matrix evaluation, worst-case scenario evaluation (WCSE), and Monte Carlo simulation methods in some of the car-following and lane-change studies when using specific models. Moreover, the agent-based model and augmented and virtual reality approaches show promising results in AV evaluation. Furthermore, integrating machine and deep learning into the available AV evaluation methods can improve their performance and generate encouraging outcomes.},

In this brief, we present the infinite HCRF (iHCRF), which is a nonparametric model based on hierarchical Dirichlet processes and is capable of automatically learning the optimal number of hidden states for a classification task. We show how we learn the model hyperparameters with an effective Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling technique, and we explain the process that underlines our iHCRF model with the Restaurant Franchise Rating Agencies analogy. We show that the iHCRF is able to converge to a correct number of represented hidden states, and outperforms the best finite HCRFs-chosen via cross-validation-for the difficult tasks of recognizing instances of agreement, disagreement, and pain. Moreover, the iHCRF manages to achieve this performance in significantly less total training, validation, and testing time.},

For an insert REBCO magnet generating ultra-high magnetic field, a new screening current method has been proposed with consideration of the coil-deformation effect. In this article, we have developed a new screening current method based on a partial element equivalent circuit (PEEC) model coupling with a two-dimensional stress finite element analysis to accurately the time-transient distribution of accurate screening current. In the presented method, the changes of self/mutual inductances are considered due to the coil deformation. As the simulation results, it was found that the coil deformation affected the screening current distribution. When considering the coil deformations, the screening current-induced fields to operating current are different for charging cycles. It is necessary to simulate the coil deformation to accurately estimate the screening current and the screening current-induced field.},

  abstract={The Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neuron is one of the most biophysically-meaningful models used in computational neuroscience today. Ironically, the model's high experimental value is offset by its disproportional computational complexity. To such an extent that neuroscientists have either resorted to simpler models, losing precious neuron detail, or to using high-performance computing systems, to gain acceleration, for complex models. However, multicore/multinode CPU-based systems have proven too slow while FPGA-based ones have proven too time-consuming to (re)deploy to. Clearly, a solution that bridges user friendliness and high speedups is necessary. This paper presents flexHH, a flexible FPGA library implementing five popular, highly parameterizable variants of the HH neuron model. flexHH is the first crucial step towards making FPGA-based simulations of compute-intensive neural models available to neuroscientists without the debilitating penalty of re-engineering and re-synthesis. Through flexHH, the user can instantiate custom models and immediately take advantage of the acceleration without the mediation of an engineer, which has proven to be a major inhibitor to full adoption of FPGAs in neuroscience labs. In terms of performance, flexHH achieves speedups between $8\times $ -$20\times $ compared to sequential-C implementations, while only a small drop in real-time capabilities is observed when compared to hardcoded FPGA-based versions of the models tested.},

  abstract={Avatars have been found to be useful tools to overcome communication barriers in people affected by Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and to help them understand and express emotions. However, it has been shown that the success of the interactions is highly dependent on the subject's identification with the avatar. In this study, we assess the variables that may influence that perception in children under 10, in the context of the largely multi-ethnic Ecuadorean society. The results reveal that, unlike previous studies showed for young adults, the ethnic traits displayed by the avatars are not a critical factor, as the the quality of the interactions was more influenced by the perception of the avatars' appearance, their similarity with the kids' peers and, above all, the ability of the human model who controls the avatar to use a pleasant voice, to succeed in making his/her questions and responses fully understood, and to master the non-verbal communication transmitted through gestures and voice.},

  pages={94239-94250},
  abstract={Understanding the relationship between driving behavior and visual information is important for holistic understanding of driving behavior. However, the analysis of the cognitive behavior for steering/throttle control has been only conducted under a special simulator environment. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) with human physical characteristics to analyze the driver's cognitive behavior and to validate that the machine learning methods can be an analytical method for understanding driver behavior. We obtained the driving data in a simulator experiment to train the proposed CNN model. The region where the visual field influences drivers' steering behavior was analyzed using the results of the feature maps generated by the trained CNN model and the driver's gaze behavior. The results indicate that the driver performs steering control using the information within 20 degrees from the gaze point. This shows that the results obtained from our proposed method can reproduce the same results as previous findings. We also validated that the results are not uniquely obtained depending on the proposed model and environment but are also influenced by the driving behavior such as the gaze point and the steering control. We analyzed the dataset generated by the mathematical control model, called the driver model, which performs different behaviors from the driver. The analysis results generated by the driver model were different from the results of the human data. Therefore, the results generated by the machine learning-based analysis are influenced by the driving behavior. Consequently, these results imply that machine learning methods have the potential to become analytical methods for understanding driver behavior.},

On account of the result of simulation and test, the contact performances are optimized. When the insulation material is not neglected, the muzzle velocity will not reduce continuously.

  year={2007},

  pages={1743-1752},
  abstract={The SPICE simulation program is widely used as a brute force simulator for analyzing and designing switching power converters. Results from SPICE are mostly useful, but their integrity is sometimes questionable as erroneous results could be obtained which may not reflect the true behavior of the circuits being simulated. Various parameters in SPICE are crucial in controlling the convergence and accuracy of the simulated results, e.g., relative error tolerance and maximum integration step size. In this paper, we study the system consisting of the SPICE simulation algorithm and the circuit being simulated. Specifically, we describe the generation of flawed solutions in terms of bifurcation of the system under parameter variations. Erroneous results have been collected for different relative error tolerances, maximum integration step sizes, and parasitic inductance and capacitance. These flawed solutions can be analyzed in terms of the manifestation of period-doubling bifurcation and chaotic behavior under variation of selected simulation parameters. This paper provides a systematic approach to rationalizing the behavior of the SPICE simulator, its practical significance being in the identification of the ranges of simulation parameters for which flawed solutions can be produced.},

  abstract={Automated sports commentary is a form of automated narrative. Sports commentary exists to keep the viewer informed and entertained. One way to entertain the viewer is by telling brief stories relevant to the game in progress. We present a system called the sports commentary recommendation system (SCoReS) that can automatically suggest stories for commentators to tell during games. Through several user studies, we compared commentary using SCoReS to three other types of commentary and show that SCoReS adds significantly to the broadcast across several enjoyment metrics. We also collected interview data from professional sports commentators who positively evaluated a demonstration of the system. We conclude that SCoReS can be a useful broadcast tool, effective at selecting stories that add to the enjoyment and watchability of sports. SCoReS is a step toward automating sports commentary and, thus, automating narrative.},

  abstract={Although game-based interactive technology has long enhanced flow experiences crucial for learning, its effects have been unclear. Thus, this study gathered students’ electroencephalogram (EEG) information during their work in game-based learning environments with different levels of technological interactivity (LTIs; low, mid, and high LTIs). Multiple measurements were used in a relatively small sample, and 3 9th graders (age 15) of different learning environments worked on 360 test items. The EEG data were analyzed with the LTI, balance of challenge and skill (BCS), and sense of control (SC) to establish the flow state construct. A chi-square test showed a significant association between flow states and the LTI, whereas a J48 decision tree analysis and logistic regression demonstrated that inflow experiences would likely emerge in students with high short-term SC (ST-SC), high BCS, and high-LTI learning environments. Furthermore, in high ST-SC and high BCS cases, the odds ratio (OR) of emerging inflow experiences with a high LTI is eight times more than the rest, suggesting that instructional designers (and teachers) use high-LTI game-based learning environments while ensuring students’ learning with adequate SC and BCS.},

  abstract={Freshwater ecosystems are among the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet and constitute key natural resources for human economies. These ecosystems, however, are endangered due to persistent human activities, whose effects range from temperature changes to water pollution. Here, we develop an online serious game to educate youth regarding human impact on freshwater ecosystems. In particular, we focus on how environmental variables can affect the behavior and well-being of freshwater fish, which are critical to the food web and the function of the whole ecosystem. In the game, players aim to maximize fish fitness by foraging and reproducing, despite adversarial environmental conditions. We leverage dynamical systems and control theory to create mathematical models for all game characters and components, including animal locomotion and hydrodynamic interactions with the flow physics of a virtual river. We test the educational value and usability of the game on a group of middle-school students from New York City. Our results suggest that games like the proposed serious game could be a viable tool to engage youth in environmental education about freshwater ecosystems.},

We present Monte Carlo tree search as a way to sample behaviors from a play space, action metrics to automate play space measurement, and predictive modeling techniques to model design spaces.

  abstract={In most modern video games, character behavior is scripted; no matter how many times the player exploits a weakness, that weakness is never repaired. Yet, if game characters could learn through interacting with the player, behavior could improve as the game is played, keeping it interesting. This paper introduces the real-time Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (rtNEAT) method for evolving increasingly complex artificial neural networks in real time, as a game is being played. The rtNEAT method allows agents to change and improve during the game. In fact, rtNEAT makes possible an entirely new genre of video games in which the player trains a team of agents through a series of customized exercises. To demonstrate this concept, the Neuroevolving Robotic Operatives (NERO) game was built based on rtNEAT. In NERO, the player trains a team of virtual robots for combat against other players' teams. This paper describes results from this novel application of machine learning, and demonstrates that rtNEAT makes possible video games like NERO where agents evolve and adapt in real time. In the future, rtNEAT may allow new kinds of educational and training applications through interactive and adapting games.},

  year={2019},
  volume={66},
  number={9},
  pages={2499-2511},
  abstract={Objective: Modeling of human motor intention plays an essential role in predictively controlling a robotic system in human-robot interaction tasks. In most machine learning techniques, human motor behavior is modeled as a generic stochastic process. However, the integration of a priori knowledge about underlying system structures can provide insights on otherwise unobservable intrinsic states that yield the superior prediction performance and increased generalization capabilities. Methods: We present a novel method for modeling human motor behavior that explicitly includes a neuroscientifically supported model of human motor control, in which the dynamics of the human arm are modeled by a mechanical impedance that tracks a latent desired trajectory. We adopt a Bayesian setting by defining Gaussian process (GP) priors for the impedance elements and the latent desired trajectory. This enables exploitation of a priori human arm impedance knowledge for regression of interaction forces through inference of a latent desired human trajectory. Results: The method is validated using simulated data, with particular focus on effects of GP prior parameterization and intention estimation capabilities. The superior prediction performance is shown with respect to a naive GP prior. An experiment with human participants evaluates generalization capabilities and effects of training data sparsity. Conclusion: We derive the correlations of an impedance-based GP model of human motor behavior that exploits a priori knowledge. Significance: The model effectively predicts interaction forces by inferring a latent desired human trajectory in previously observed as well as unobserved regions of the input space.},

  title={A Taxonomy for Quality in Simulation-Based Development and Testing of Automated Driving Systems}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={10},
  number={},
  pages={18631-18644},
  abstract={Ensuring the quality of automated driving systems is a major challenge the automotive industry faces. In this context, quality defines the degree to which an object meets expectations and requirements. Especially, highly automated and automated vehicles at SAE levels 4 and 5 will be expected to operate safely in various contexts and complex situations without misconduct. Thus, a systematic approach is needed to show their safe operation. A way to address this challenge is simulation-based testing, as pure physical testing is not feasible for automated driving at levels 4 and 5 since several billion kilometers of driving are necessary. During simulation-based testing, the data used to evaluate the actual quality of an automated driving system are generated using a simulation. However, to rely on these simulation data, the overall simulation, including its simulation models, must provide a certain quality level. This quality level depends on the intended purpose for which the generated simulation data should be used. Therefore, three categories of quality can be considered: simulation quality (e.g., reliable simulation tool), quality of the automated driving system (e.g., handling of dangerous situations), and scenario quality (e.g., scenario criticality). Quality must be determined and evaluated in various process steps in developing and testing automated driving systems, the overall simulation, and the simulation models used for the simulation. In this paper, we propose a conceptual taxonomy to better understand quality in the development and testing process to have a clear separation and insight where further testing is needed – both in terms of automated driving systems and simulation, including their simulation models and scenarios used for testing.},

Research shows that humans can sometimes become very abusive towards computers and robots particularly when they are seen as human-like and this raises important ethical issues.The designers of robotic systems need to take an ethical stance on at least three specific questions. Firstly is it acceptable to treat artefacts – particularly human-like artefacts – in ways that we would consider it morally unacceptable to treat humans? Second, if so, just how much sexual or violent ‘abuse’ of an artificial agent should we allow before we censure the behaviour of the abuser? Thirdly is it ethical for designers to attempt to ‘design out’ abusive behaviour by users?Conclusions on these and related issues should be used to modify professional codes as a matter of urgency.},

  abstract={Fully understanding the dynamics of particles induced by magnetic fields with considering particle-particle interaction is an interesting and important issue for delivering magnetic particles to a target site with a high efficiency. For this purpose, permanent magnets with horizontal and vertical magnetization directions respectively have been taken for generating two types of gradient magnetic fields, which are applied to produce similar gradient magnetic forces while with different magnetic interaction forces between particles. On this basis, the distributions of particles under the two gradient magnetic fields are investigated and compared using Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that the concentrated particles have chainlike structures and their distributions are configuration dependent with the magnetization direction of permanent magnets: parallel and perpendicular to the bottom line for horizontal and vertical magnetization directions, respectively. Above all, a detailed microscopy study reveals that the movement trajectories of magnetic particles are affected by both transport and aggregation behavior of particles and the microscopic visualizations of particle distributions in the target region are in agreement with simulation predictions.},

The multi-agent system architecture ensures seamless communication and coordination, facilitating the delivery of tailored exercises that cater to the evolving needs of patients, either in person or remotely. Key to our approach is the use of gamification, which transforms rehabilitation exercises into interactive virtual activities, significantly enhancing patient engagement and motivation. Preliminary results demonstrate the platform’s efficacy in improving balance, highlighting its potential as a versatile tool for balance disorder treatment. This research advances the technological frontier in balance disorder rehabilitation and offers a blueprint for future telehealth and patient-centric care innovations.},

  pages={74818-74830},
  abstract={Transient simulation in power engineering is crucial as it models the dynamic behavior of power systems during sudden events like faults or short circuits. Electromagnetic transient simulations involve multiple coordinated tasks. Traditional simulations are centralized and struggle to meet scalability requirements. To achieve these goals, distributed electromagnetic transient simulation has emerged as a new trend. Nevertheless, the distributed electromagnetic transient simulation introduces network communication. Achieving real-time simulation across distributed nodes poses the challenge of minimizing communication costs. In this paper, our proposal focuses on optimizing the task orchestration to reduce communication costs. Specifically, in the electromagnetic transient simulation, these tasks has certain communication pattern where the communicated objects of each task are pre-defined. We represent the pattern as a graph, with tasks represented as nodes and communications as edges. Furthermore, we propose to use graph partition with the objective of minimal communication costs and fine tune the partitions with the resource requirements of each distributed node. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposal has strength in achieving high-performance electromagnetic transient simulation.},

  year={2024},
  volume={36},
  number={11},
  pages={2495-2517},
  abstract={Making sense of natural language and narratives requires building and manipulating a situation model by adding incoming information to the model and using the context stored in the model to comprehend subsequent details and events. Situation model maintenance is supported by the default mode network (DMN), but comprehension of the individual moments in the narrative relies on access to the conceptual store within the semantic system. The present study examined how these systems are engaged by different narrative content to investigate whether highly informative, or semantic, content is a particularly strong driver of semantic system activation compared with contextually driven content that requires using the situation model, which might instead engage DMN regions. The study further investigated which subregions of the graded semantic hub in the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL) were engaged by the type of narrative content. To do this, we quantified the semantic, pragmatic, social, ambiguous, and emotional content for each sentence in a complete narrative, the English translation of The Little Prince. Increased activation in the transmodal hub in the ventral ATL was only observed for high semantic (i.e., informative) relative to low semantic sentences. Activation in the dorsolateral and ventrolateral ATL subregions was observed for both high relative to low semantic and social content sentences, but the ventrolateral ATL effects were more extensive in the social condition. There was high correspondence between the social and pragmatic content results, particularly in the ventrolateral ATL. We argue that the ventrolateral ATL may be particularly engaged by internal, or endogenous, processing demands, aided by functional connections between the anterior middle temporal gyrus and the DMN. Pragmatic and social content may have driven endogenous processing given the pervasive and plot-progressing nature of this content in the narrative. We put forward a revised account of how the semantic system is engaged in naturalistic contexts, a critical step toward better understanding real-world semantic and social processing.},

  title={Investigating the Impact of Gaming Habits, Gender, and Age on the Effectiveness of an Educational Video Game: An Exploratory Study}, 
  year={2017},

  abstract={This study examines the influence of players' age, gender, and gaming preferences and habits (from now on, “gaming preferences”) on the effectiveness of a specific videogame that has been designed to increase the interest towards classical theater among teenagers. Using a validated instrument, participants were divided into four groups based on their gaming preferences: (1) Well-rounded (WR) gamers, who play all types of games often; (2) Hardcore players, who frequently tend to play first-person shooter (FPS) and sports games; (3) Casual players, who play moderately and tend to play music, social, and puzzle games; and (4) Non-gamers, who barely play videogames at all. Among all of the participants' personal factors (age, gender, and type of player) that were measured, only gaming preferences seemed to have a significant (p<;.05) positive influence on students' interest in theater-going. Neither age nor gender seemed to affect the outcomes. Casual and Well-rounded gamers scored higher in the game than Non-gamers and Hardcore players. Due to these results, we also explored whether the gaming profile affected traditional educational approaches. Traditional education worked better than videogames only for students who do not usually play videogames. This study suggests that gaming preferences may influence the effectiveness of different educational approaches. Knowing students' gaming preferences in advance may help educators find the best educational approach for each student.},

  abstract={Full-chip electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection circuit design verification is needed for complex ICs at advanced technology nodes despite being largely impractical due to the limitation of ESD device models and CAD tools. This paper reports a new circuit-level ESD protection design simulation and dynamic checking method using SPICE and ESD device behavior models which allows comprehensive, quantitative, and dynamic verification of ESD protection circuit designs at chip level-based entirely on ESD discharging functions. The new ESD protection circuit simulation method is validated using ICs designed and fabricated in a 28 nm CMOS.

  title={Realization of Game Mechanics in Virtual Reality for Amblyopia Treatment}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={12},

  pages={145018-145037},
  abstract={The number of Amblyopia cases has been constantly rising in the recent times. Difficulty in regular clinical visits for therapy has created a need for a monitored engaging home-based amblyopia treatment. In this regard, various technological designs are proposed of which gamified VR amblyopia treatment has showcased positive outcomes over time. However in this work, we identify a need to understand and improvise the gamified VR amblyopia treatment in terms of attentional & engaging elements for better engageability and ensure correlation of stimulus in the virtual environment to the real world for test efficacy. Additionally, correlating the distance and stimulus parameters in VR to the real world is showcased as a design guideline for which the visual acuity test yielded a positive correlation (r =0.845, p =0.002 at  $\alpha =0.01$ , N =10). To identify the XR interaction game mechanics promoting engagement and motivation in users for regular treatment, a user based study is conducted. The identified game mechanics with a cognitive task load (NASA TLX, M =12.26) are later mapped with the recognised amblyopia characteristics to propose a prototype of XR amblyopic game mechanics. The prototype is evaluated for motivational and engagement factors through Octalysis (Score =332). System Usability Scale and Nielsen’s Heuristic Evaluation are further used to evaluate the design by the experts. Results obtained (SUS, M =72.8 & Heuristics, M >60% and N =10) demonstrate the potential usability of the prototype as home-based gamified amblyopia treatment.},

  abstract={An in-depth study on driving habits and personalized driving-assistance systems is conducive to the realization of vehicle safety and intelligent driving. In this paper, we present a personalized vehicle lane-change assistance system integrated with a driver-behavior identification strategy. First, the driver-behavior data-acquisition system is designed and established. Based on this, the input data of different kinds of drivers along with vehicle signals are collected under typical working conditions. The drivers are classified utilizing factor analysis and a fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm, and the identification of driver behavior is realized using a backpropagation neural network optimized by a particle swarm optimization algorithm. Then, personalized warning, planning, and control systems are designed for lane changing. The proposed personalized lane-change assistance system can provide more personalized recommendations to the drivers, increasing the potential for more widespread acceptance and use of advanced driver-assistance system. Finally, the correctness of the proposed personalized lane-change system is evaluated by conducting computer simulations and a driver-in-the-loop- simulation under various conditions. And the results show that the lane-change assistance system based on driver behavior can meet the driving needs of different drivers without sacrificing safety.},

  year={2018},
  volume={28},
  number={3},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This paper presents the thermal and electromagnetic behaviors of multistacked no-insulation (NI) REBa2Cu3O7-x (REBCO, RE = rare earth) pancake coils. The NI winding technique gives a high enough thermal stability not to damage REBCO coils even though a normal-state transition occurs. The high thermal stability has been verified through overcurrent tests. Moreover, the numerical simulation of multistacked NI REBCO pancake coils has been performed to investigate the electromagnetic behaviors in detail. The simulation results also confirmed the high thermal stability of NI REBCO pancake coils. However, it does not mean that an NI REBCO magnet never quenches. In experiments, it was observed that a quench in one of the pancake coils propagated to the other pancake coils sequentially. The above sequential quench from pancake to pancake has not been confirmed in the numerical simulation since the thermal behavior is not considered. For the more reliable verification, we have developed a numerical simulation to investigate the thermal and electromagnetic behaviors by the partial element equivalent circuit method and the two-dimensional thermal finite-element method. In this paper, the six-stacked NI REBCO pancake coil is simulated with several operating temperatures, and the sequential quench is reproduced. The velocity of the sequential quench is also shown.},

  abstract={Considering the distances to exits, exits' capacities, the sizes of queues at exits, distances to the nuclear power plant, as well as individual characteristics, the exit choice model for pedestrians in the plume planning area is established based on a random forest model. This model is trained and verified with the survey data of residents around the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant collected from a serious game-based questionnaire system. Combining the pedestrian choice with the agent-based pedestrian behavior simulation model, the evacuation process of a nuclear accident is simulated. Based on the detailed evacuation simulation model, a comparative experiment is performed to evaluate the staged evacuation strategy in such scenarios. Simulation results indicate that staged evacuation may not be the best strategy all the time, and the number of groups highly impacts its performance.},

This paper explores whether we could embed our behavior modeling framework (described in the companion paper, Part 1) behind a legacy first person shooter 3D game environment to recreate portions of the Black Hawk Down scenario. Section 1 amplifies the interoperability needs and challenges confronting the field, presents the questions that are examined, and describes the test scenario. Sections 2 and 3 review the software and knowledge engineering methodology, respectively, needed to create the system and populate it with bots. Results (Section 4) and discussion (Section 5) reveal that we were able to generate plausible and adaptive recreations of Somalian crowds, militia, women acting as shields, suicide bombers, and more. Also, there are specific lessons learned about ways to advance the field so that such interoperabilities will become more affordable and widespread.},

  abstract={Recent advances in the digital gaming industry have provided impressive demonstrations of highly skilful artificial intelligence agents capable of performing complex intelligent behaviours. Additionally, there is a significant increase in demand for intelligent agents that can imitate video game characters and human players to increase the perceived value of engagement, entertainment, and satisfaction. The believability of an artificial agent’s behaviour is usually measured only by its ability in a specific task. Recent research has shown that ability alone is not enough to identify human-like behaviour. In this work, we propose a case-based reasoning (CBR) approach to develop human-like agents using human gameplay traces to reduce model-based programming effort. The proposed framework builds on the demonstrated case storage, retrieval and solution methods by emphasizing the impact of seven different similarity measures. The goal of this framework is to allow agents to learn from a small number of demonstrations of a given task and immediately generalize to new scenarios of the same task without task-specific development. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using instrumental measures of accuracy and similarity with multiple loss functions, e.g. by comparing traces left by agents and players. The study also developed an automated process to generate a corpus for a simulation case study of the Pac-Man game to validate our proposed model. We provide empirical evidence that CBR systems recognize human player behaviour more accurately than trained models, with an average accuracy of 75%, and are easy to deploy. The believability of play styles between human players and AI agents was measured using two automated methods to validate the results. We show that the high p-values produced by these two methods confirm the believability of our trained agents.},

  abstract={Lovelace and Cios (2008) recently proposed a very simple spiking neuron (VSSN) model for simulations of large neuronal networks as an efficient replacement for the integrate-and-fire neuron model. We argue that the VSSN model falls behind key advances in neuronal network modeling over the past 20 years, in particular, techniques that permit simulators to compute the state of the neuron without repeated summation over the history of input spikes and to integrate the subthreshold dynamics exactly. State-of-the-art solvers for networks of integrate-and-fire model neurons are substantially more efficient than the VSSN simulator and allow routine simulations of networks of some 105 neurons and 109 connections on moderate computer clusters.},

  abstract={This paper brings together topics of two of Berger’s main contributions to information theory: distributed source coding, and living information theory. Our goal is to understand which information theory techniques can be helpful in understanding a distributed source coding strategy used by the natural world. Towards this goal, we study the example of the encoding of location of an animal by grid cells in its brain. We use information measures of partial information decomposition (PID) to assess the unique, redundant, and synergistic information carried by multiple grid cells, first for simulated grid cells utilizing known encodings, and subsequently for data from real grid cells. In all cases, we make simplifying assumptions so we can assess the consistency of specific PID definitions with intuition. Our results suggest that the measure of PID proposed by Bertschinger et al. (Entropy, 2014) provides intuitive insights on distributed source coding by grid cells, and can be used for subsequent studies for understanding grid-cell encoding as well as broadly in neuroscience.},

  abstract={This paper presents the pediAnklebot, an impedance-controlled low-friction, backdriveable robotic device developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that trains the ankle of neurologically impaired children of ages 6-10 years old. The design attempts to overcome the known limitations of the lower extremity robotics and the unknown difficulties of what constitutes an appropriate therapeutic interaction with children. The robot's pilot clinical evaluation is on-going and it incorporates our recent findings on the ankle sensorimotor control in neurologically intact subjects, namely the speed-accuracy tradeoff, the deviation from an ideally smooth ankle trajectory, and the reaction time. We used these concepts to develop the kinematic and kinetic performance metrics that guided the ankle therapy in a similar fashion that we have done for our upper extremity devices. Here we report on the use of the device in at least nine training sessions for three neurologically impaired children. Results demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the performance metrics assessing explicit and implicit motor learning. Based on these initial results, we are confident that the device will become an effective tool that harnesses plasticity to guide habilitation during childhood.},

  abstract={We present the results of a double-blind phase 2b randomized control trial that used a custom built virtual reality environment for the cognitive rehabilitation of stroke survivors. A stroke causes damage to the brain and problem solving, memory and task sequencing are commonly affected. The brain can recover to some extent, however, and stroke patients have to relearn how to carry out activities of daily living. We have created an application called VIRTUE to enable such activities to be practiced using immersive virtual reality. Gamification techniques enhance the motivation of patients such as by making the level of difficulty of a task increase over time. The design and implementation of VIRTUE is described together with the results of the trial conducted within the Stroke Unit of a large hospital. We report on the safety and acceptability of VIRTUE. We have also observed particular benefits of VR treatment for stroke survivors that experienced more severe cognitive impairment, and an encouraging reduction in time spent in the hospital for all patients that received the VR treatment.},

  year={2022},
  volume={28},
  number={5},
  pages={2003-2013},
  abstract={Understanding and modeling the dynamics of human gaze behavior in 360° environments is crucial for creating, improving, and developing emerging virtual reality applications. However, recruiting human observers and acquiring enough data to analyze their behavior when exploring virtual environments requires complex hardware and software setups, and can be time-consuming. Being able to generate virtual observers can help overcome this limitation, and thus stands as an open problem in this medium. Particularly, generative adversarial approaches could alleviate this challenge by generating a large number of scanpaths that reproduce human behavior when observing new scenes, essentially mimicking virtual observers. However, existing methods for scanpath generation do not adequately predict realistic scanpaths for 360° images. We present ScanGAN360, a new generative adversarial approach to address this problem. We propose a novel loss function based on dynamic time warping and tailor our network to the specifics of 360° images. The quality of our generated scanpaths outperforms competing approaches by a large margin, and is almost on par with the human baseline. ScanGAN360 allows fast simulation of large numbers of virtual observers, whose behavior mimics real users, enabling a better understanding of gaze behavior, facilitating experimentation, and aiding novel applications in virtual reality and beyond.},

  abstract={Contribution: This article compares the effectiveness for online software engineering education of video-based learning and game-based learning using teacher-authored educational video games created by using authoring tools. Background: Although substantial research has evaluated the impact of video-based and game-based learning versus traditional teaching approaches, little research has been done comparing the effectiveness of video-based learning and video game-based learning. Furthermore, the few studies that performed this comparison did not compare the effectiveness for online education or examined teacher-authored video games. Research Questions: Is game-based learning using teacher-authored video games more effective than video-based learning in terms of knowledge acquisition for software engineering students in online settings? Is game-based learning using teacher-authored video games more effective than video-based learning in terms of motivation for software engineering students in online settings? Methodology: A quasi-experimental design with control and experimental groups and pre- and post-tests was employed. A total of 180 software engineering students participated in this study, 81 of which belonged to the control group while the other 99 were part of the experimental group. The students in the control group took an online lesson in which they learned exclusively by watching videos, whereas the students in the experimental group took the same lesson but learned exclusively by playing an educational video game created by a teacher through an authoring tool. Findings: The results show that game-based learning using teacher-authored educational video games was more effective than video-based learning in terms of both knowledge acquisition and motivation.},

  abstract={We describe a systematic analysis of relativistic magnetron behavior via direct numerical simulation, which is compared with experimental data from the Physics International (PI) magnetron where possible. Throughout, we have sought to isolate individual physical processes, but even so, we are able to reproduce most features of the experiment qualitatively, and many quantitatively within the limitations of the model. Specifically, we find that magnetron operation is effectively limited to a comparatively small region of parameter, space and distant from both the Hull and Buneman-Hartree curves, and further curtailed by mode competition. Where effective operation does occur, we have been able to reproduce the experimentally observed pulse shortening and, on the basis of our simulations, are able to suggest a cure. Our evidence is that comprehensive modeling of magnetrons can facilitate the making of critical design decisions, thereby enabling the devices to meet demanding specifications for power and energy delivery.},

  pages={199-212},
  abstract={Simulation is critical when studying real operational behavior of increasingly complex Cyber-Physical Systems, forecasting future behavior, and experimenting with hypothetical scenarios. A critical aspect of simulation is the ability to evaluate large-scale systems within a reasonable time frame while modeling complex interactions between millions of components. However, modern simulations face limitations in provisioning this functionality for CPSs in terms of balancing simulation complexity with performance, resulting in substantial operational costs required for completing simulation execution. Moreover, users are required to have expertise in modeling and configuring simulations to infrastructure which is time consuming. In this paper we present Simulation EnvironmEnt Distributor (SEED), a novel approach for simulating large-scale CPSs across a loosely-coupled distributed system requiring minimal user configuration. This is achieved through automated simulation partitioning and instantiation while enforcing tight event messaging across the system. SEED operates efficiently within both small and large-scale OTS hardware, agnostic of cluster heterogeneity and OS running, and is capable of simulating the full system and network stack of a CPS. Our approach is validated through experiments conducted in a cluster to simulate CPS operation. Results demonstrate that SEED is capable of simulating CPSs containing 2,000,000 tasks across 2,000 nodes with only 6.89× slow down relative to real time, and executes effectively across distributed infrastructure.},

  pages={1-14},
  abstract={This paper describes the NeuroBot system, which uses a global workspace architecture, implemented in spiking neurons, to control an avatar within the Unreal Tournament 2004 (UT2004) computer game. This system is designed to display humanlike behavior within UT2004, which provides a good environment for comparing human and embodied AI behavior without the cost and difficulty of full humanoid robots. Using a biologically inspired approach, the architecture is loosely based on theories about the high-level control circuits in the brain, and it is the first neural implementation of a global workspace that has been embodied in a complex dynamic real-time environment. NeuroBot's humanlike behavior was tested by competing in the 2011 BotPrize competition, in which human judges play UT2004 and rate the humanness of other avatars that are controlled by a human or a bot. NeuroBot came a close second, achieving a humanness rating of 36%, while the most human human reached 67%. We also developed a humanness metric that combines a number of statistical measures of an avatar's behavior into a single number. In our experiments with this metric, NeuroBot was rated as 33% human, and the most human human achieved 73%.},

  abstract={Reliable data congestion analytics in crowdsourced eHealth networks becomes particularly important, especially in big data era, because of wide adaption of ubiquitous crowdsourced healthcare participants. Since a crowdsourced eHealth network has intermittent connectivity to its remote healthcare provider, researchers usually use some well-studied networks to model the novel network, but data congestion analytics is still a big problem in most intermittent connecting networks. In most cases, data congestion analytics may be realized by fixing the number of forwarded copies, but sometimes, it cannot suit the changing network environments well. This problem could be solved by modifying packet forwarding conditions dynamically through detecting real-time network environment. Based on this idea, in this paper, an optimized routing algorithm named RSW (reduced variable neighborhood search-based spray and wait) is proposed. In the algorithm, nodes will exchange and store each other's buffer status during their communication, based on which, current network environments will be evaluated and quantified as a real-time threshold. Then, spray and wait adapts the threshold for data congestion control. Simulation shows that the proposed algorithm increases data packet delivery probability, and optimize the overhead ratio dramatically, which can be up to ten times lower than that of standard algorithm.},

  title={Potential Impacts of Smart Homes on Human Behavior: A Reinforcement Learning Approach}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={3},
  number={4},
  pages={567-580},
  abstract={Smart homes are becoming increasingly popular as a result of advances in machine learning and cloud computing. Devices, such as smart thermostats and speakers, are now capable of learning from user feedback and adaptively adjust their settings to human preferences. Nonetheless, these devices might in turn impact human behavior. To investigate the potential impacts of smart homes on human behavior, we simulate a series of hierarchical-reinforcement learning-based human models capable of performing various activities—namely, setting temperature and humidity for thermal comfort inside a Q-Learning-based smart home model. We then investigate the possibility of the human models’ behaviors being altered as a result of the smart home and the human model adapting to one another. For our human model, the activities are based on hierarchical-reinforcement learning. This allows the human to learn how long it must continue a given activity and decide when to leave it. We then integrate our human model in the environment along with the smart home model and perform rigorous experiments considering various scenarios involving a model of a single human and models of two different humans with the smart home. Our experiments show that with the smart home, the human model can exhibit unexpected behaviors such as frequent changing of activities and an increase in the time required to modify the thermal preferences. With two human models, we interestingly observe that certain combinations of models result in normal behaviors, while other combinations exhibit the same unexpected behaviors as those observed from the single human experiment.},

  pages={402-411},
  abstract={In this paper, we present The Best Laid Plans, an interactive narrative adventure game, and the planning technologies used to generate and adapt its story in real time. The game leverages computational models of intentionality and conflict when controlling the non-player characters (NPCs) to ensure they act believably and introduce challenge into the automatically generated narratives. We evaluate the game's ability to generate NPC behaviors that human players recognize as intentional and as conflicting with their plans. We demonstrate that players recognize these phenomena significantly more than in a control with no NPC actions and not significantly different from a control in which NPC actions are defined by a human author.},

  year={2023},

  abstract={Over the last decades, conventional transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has been utilized as an efficient rehabilitation intervention for alleviation of chronic pain, including phantom limb pain (PLP). However, recently the literature has increasingly focused on alternative temporal stimulation patterns such as pulse width modulation (PWM). While the effect of non-modulated high frequency (NMHF) TENS on somatosensory (SI) cortex activity and sensory perception has been studied, the possible alteration following PWM TENS at the SI has not yet been explored. Therefore, we investigated the cortical modulation by PWM TENS for the first time and conducted a comparative analysis with the conventional TENS pattern. We recorded sensory evoked potentials (SEP) from 14 healthy subjects before, immediately, and 60 min after TENS interventions (PWM and NMHF). The results revealed suppression of SEP components, theta, and alpha band power simultaneously associated with the perceived intensity reduction when the single sensory pulses applied ipsilaterally to the TENS side. The reduction of N1 amplitude, theta, and alpha band activity occurred immediately after both patterns remained at least 60 min. However, the P2 wave was suppressed right after PWM TENS, while NMHF could not induce significant reduction immediately after the intervention phase. As such, since PLP relief has been shown to be correlated with inhibition at somatosensory cortex, we, therefore, believe that the result of this study provides further evidence that PWM TENS may also be potential therapeutic intervention for PLP reduction. Future studies on PLP patients with PWM TENS sessions is needed to validate our result.},

  year={1999},
  volume={18},

  pages={32-42},
  abstract={The authors describe almost entirely automated procedures for estimation of global, voxel, and cluster-level statistics to test the null hypothesis of zero neuroanatomical difference between two groups of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Theoretical distributions under the null hypothesis are available for (1) global tissue class volumes; (2) standardized linear model [analysis of variance (ANOVA and ANCOVA)] coefficients estimated at each voxel; and (3) an area of spatially connected clusters generated by applying an arbitrary threshold to a two-dimensional (2-D) map of normal statistics at voxel level. The authors describe novel methods for economically ascertaining probability distributions under the null hypothesis, with fewer assumptions, by permutation of the observed data. Nominal Type I error control by permutation testing is generally excellent; whereas theoretical distributions may be over conservative. Permutation has the additional advantage that it can be used to test any statistic of interest, such as the sum of suprathreshold voxel statistics in a cluster (or cluster mass), regardless of its theoretical tractability under the null hypothesis. These issues are illustrated by application to MRI data acquired from 18 adolescents with hyperkinetic disorder and 16 control subjects matched for age and gender.},

  abstract={For learning to improve the adaptiveness of an animal's behavior, and thus direct evolution in the way Baldwin suggested, the learning mechanism must incorporate an innate evaluation of how the animal's actions influence its reproductive fitness. For example, many circumstances that damage an animal or otherwise reduce its fitness are painful and tend to be avoided. We refer to the mechanism by which an animal evaluates the fitness consequences of its actions as a “motivation system,” and argue that such a system must evolve along with the behaviors it evaluates. We describe simulations of the evolution of populations of agents instantiating a number of different architectures for generating action and learning in worlds of differing complexity. We find that in some cases, members of the populations evolve motivation systems that are accurate enough to direct learning so as to increase the fitness of the actions that the agents perform. Furthermore, the motivation systems tend to incorporate systematic distortions in their representations of the worlds they inhabit; these distortions can increase the adaptiveness of the behavior generated.},
