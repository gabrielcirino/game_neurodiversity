  title={Improving the Representativeness of Simulation Intervals for the Cache Memory System}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={12},
  number={},
  pages={5973-5985},
  abstract={Accurate simulation techniques are indispensable to efficiently propose new memory or architectural organizations. As implementing new hardware concepts in real systems is often not feasible, cycle-accurate simulators employed together with certain benchmarks are commonly used. However, detailed simulators may take too much time to execute these programs until completion. Therefore, several techniques aimed at reducing this time are usually employed. These schemes select fragments of the source code considered as representative of the entire application’s behaviour–mainly in terms of performance, but not plenty considering the behaviour of cache memory levels–and only these intervals are simulated. Our hypothesis is that the different simulation windows currently employed when evaluating microarchitectural proposals, especially those involving the last level cache (LLC), do not reproduce the overall cache behaviour during the entire execution, potentially leading to wrong conclusions on the real performance of the proposals assessed. In this work, we first demonstrate this hypothesis by evaluating different cache replacement policies using various typical simulation approaches. Consequently, we also propose a simulation strategy, based on the applications’ LLC activity, which mimics the overall behaviour of the cache much closer than conventional simulation intervals. Our proposal allows a fairer comparison between cache-related approaches as it reports, on average, a number of changes in the relative order among the policies assessed – with respect to the full simulation – more than 30% lower than that of conventional strategies, maintaining the simulation time largely unchanged and without losing accuracy on performance terms, especially for memory-intensive applications.},

  title={Typically Efficient Lipreading without Motor Simulation}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={33},
  number={4},
  pages={611-621},
  abstract={All it takes is a face-to-face conversation in a noisy environment to realize that viewing a speaker's lip movements contributes to speech comprehension. What are the processes underlying the perception and interpretation of visual speech? Brain areas that control speech production are also recruited during lipreading. This finding raises the possibility that lipreading may be supported, at least to some extent, by a covert unconscious imitation of the observed speech movements in the observer's own speech motor system—a motor simulation. However, whether, and if so to what extent, motor simulation contributes to visual speech interpretation remains unclear. In two experiments, we found that several participants with congenital facial paralysis were as good at lipreading as the control population and performed these tasks in a way that is qualitatively similar to the controls despite severely reduced or even completely absent lip motor representations. Although it remains an open question whether this conclusion generalizes to other experimental conditions and to typically developed participants, these findings considerably narrow the space of hypothesis for a role of motor simulation in lipreading. Beyond its theoretical significance in the field of speech perception, this finding also calls for a re-examination of the more general hypothesis that motor simulation underlies action perception and interpretation developed in the frameworks of motor simulation and mirror neuron hypotheses.},

  title={Hierarchical model for real time simulation of virtual human crowds}, 
  year={2001},
  volume={7},
  number={2},
  pages={152-164},
  abstract={We describe a model for simulating crowds of humans in real time. We deal with a hierarchy composed of virtual crowds, groups, and individuals. The groups are the most complex structure that can be controlled in different degrees of autonomy. This autonomy refers to the extent to which the virtual agents are independent of user intervention and also the amount of information needed to simulate crowds. Thus, depending on the complexity of the simulation, simple behaviors can be sufficient to simulate crowds. Otherwise, more complicated behavioral rules can be necessary and, in this case, it can be included in the simulation data in order to improve the realism of the animation. We present three different ways for controlling crowd behaviors: by using innate and scripted behaviors; by defining behavioral rules, using events and reactions; and by providing an external control to guide crowd behaviors in real time. The two main contributions of our approach are: the possibility of increasing the complexity of group/agent behaviors according to the problem to be simulated and the hierarchical structure based on groups to compose a crowd.},

Particular attention is paid to the theoretical foundations of the model, to its computational implementation, and to a number of simulations of man-machine system interactions. The approach followed in COSIMO is to build a structure for the various kinds of cognitive functions that are performed by an operator in complex environments, e.g., information seeking, pattern recognition and diagnosis, monitoring, planning, and acting on the system. For the implementation of COSIMO a blackboard architecture has been chosen. This architecture offers enough flexibility and modularity for modeling the overall state of the human and of the environment.<>},

  abstract={The GreenSoul project introduces an innovative energy-efficient platform which enhances traditional public-use buildings with various technologies, such as smart adaptors, energy analyzers, an occupant aware decision support engine, mobile applications, and interactive ambient interfaces. These enhancement aims to directly improve the interactions between occupants and energy-consuming assets in their environment. The GreenSoul framework is further enriched by the deployment of lightweight edgecomputing GreenSoul-ed devices, which reduce energy consumption by cooperating with other devices, smart metering equipment and, very importantly, with eco-aware users. The decision making process is supported by a socio-economic behavioral model, which provides the necessary understanding of occupant indoor behavior toward transforming energy consuming devices into active pro-sustainability agents that inform users how energy-efficiently they operate them, provide notifications as to improve that aspect, and even adapt their own functioning to reduce energy waste. These eco-wise devices, which are coined as GreenSoul-ed Things, are explained in detail throughout this paper as well as the sensor-based architecture that supports their operation. The deployment of the framework across six pilot buildings is addressed, as well as the designed experimental setting to corroborate the potential of such a collaborative approach to enhance energy efficiency in office buildings.},

  year={2018},
  volume={33},

  pages={10774-10783},
  abstract={Transistor models have been playing a key role in designing efficient power converters. As the operating frequency of the converters becomes higher, transistor models need to represent physical device behavior accurately. This paper proposes a comprehensive surface-potential-based model of silicon carbide (SiC) power MOSFETs that realizes accurate circuit simulations. Whereas conventional simulation models are based on empirical formulas, the proposed model is constructed in a surface-potential-based framework by considering the physical structure and behavior of vertical power SiC MOSFETs. The proposed model represents both I–V and C–V characteristics from weak inversion to the high-power region. In addition, the proposed model calculates the channel mobility degradation due to SiC/SiO$_2$ interface traps, which significantly affects the circuit performance. Through experiments using a commercial SiC power MOSFET, excellent agreements are obtained between measurement and simulation in I–V and  C–V characteristics at various temperatures for wide power ranges up to 1 kW. The transient behavior of a double-pulse tester is also well reproduced within a timing error of 12.6 ns even under the high temperature.},

  title={Parallel Stochastic Discrete Event Simulation of Calcium Dynamics in Neuron}, 
  year={2019},
  volume={16},
  number={3},
  pages={1007-1019},
  abstract={The intra-cellular calcium signaling pathways of a neuron depends on both biochemical reactions and diffusions. Some quasi-isolated compartments (e.g., spines) are so small and calcium concentrations are so low that one extra molecule diffusing in by chance can make a nontrivial difference in concentration (percentage-wise). These rare events can affect dynamics discretely in such a way that they cannot be evaluated by a deterministic and continuous simulation. Stochastic models of such a system provide a more detailed understanding of these systems than existing deterministic models because they capture their behavior at a molecular level. Our research focuses on the development of a high performance parallel discrete event simulation environment, Neuron Time Warp (NTW), which is intended for use in the parallel simulation of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems such as intra-calcium signaling. NTW is integrated with NEURON, a simulator which is widely used within the neuroscience community. We simulate two models, a calcium buffer and a calcium wave model. The calcium buffer model is employed in order to verify the correctness and performance of NTW by comparing it to a sequential deterministic simulation in NEURON. We also derived a discrete event calcium wave model from a deterministic model using the stochastic IP3R structure.},

  year={2019},
  volume={63},

  pages={8:1-8:10},
  abstract={Narrative generation, understood as the task of constructing computational models of the way in which humans build stories, has been shown to involve a number of separate processes, related to different purposes to which it can be applied, and focusing on specific features that make stories valuable. This paper reviews a set of story generation systems developed by the authors of this contribution, each focusing on different aspects and functions of stories. These systems provide an initial breakdown of how the term “storytelling” might be either instantiated or broken down into component processes. The systems cover functionalities such as generating valid plot structures, simulating character's behaviors or the evolution of affinities between them, either reporting or fictionalizing events observed in real life, and revising a story draft to maximize the suspense it induces in its readers. These functionalities are not intended to exhaust the set of possible operations involved in storytelling, but they constitute an initial set to understand the complexity of the task. The paper also includes two proposals—one theoretical and one technological—for understanding how a set of such functionalities might be composed into a broader operational process that produces more elaborate stories.},

  abstract={Natural evolution gives the impression of leading to an open-ended process of increasing diversity and complexity. If our goal is to produce such open-endedness artificially, this suggests an approach driven by evolutionary metaphor. On the other hand, techniques from machine learning and artificial intelligence are often considered too narrow to provide the sort of exploratory dynamics associated with evolution. In this article, we hope to bridge that gap by reviewing common barriers to open-endedness in the evolution-inspired approach and how they are dealt with in the evolutionary case—collapse of diversity, saturation of complexity, and failure to form new kinds of individuality. We then show how these problems map onto similar ones in the machine learning approach, and discuss how the same insights and solutions that alleviated those barriers in evolutionary approaches can be ported over. At the same time, the form these issues take in the machine learning formulation suggests new ways to analyze and resolve barriers to open-endedness. Ultimately, we hope to inspire researchers to be able to interchangeably use evolutionary and gradient-descent-based machine learning methods to approach the design and creation of open-ended systems.},

  abstract={The pursuer-evader (PE) game is recognized as an important domain in which to study the coevolution of robust adaptive behavior and protean behavior (Mifier and Cliff, 1994). Nevertheless, the potential of the game is largely unrealized due to methodological hurdles in coevolutionary simulation raised by PE; versions of the game that have optimal solutions (Isaacs, 1965) are closed-ended, while other formulations are opaque with respect to their solution space, for the lack of a rigorous metric of agent behavior. This inability to characterize behavior, in turn, obfuscates coevolutionary dynamics. We present a new formulation of PE that affords a rigorous measure of agent behavior and system dynamics. The game is moved from the two-dimensional plane to the one-dimensional bitstring; at each time step, the evader generates a bit that the pursuer must simultaneously predict. Because behavior is expressed as a time series, we can employ information theory to provide quantitative analysis of agent activity. Further, this version of PE opens vistas onto the communicative component of pursuit and evasion behavior, providing an open-ended serial communications channel and an open world (via coevolution). Results show that subtle changes to our game determine whether it is open-ended, and profoundly affect the viability of arms-race dynamics.},

  abstract={Estimating the impact of anthropogenic sound on marine animals entails consideration of animal location in the vertical and horizontal planes and the behavior of the animal (e.g., breeding, foraging, migration) at the time of sound exposure. To approach more realistic impact estimates, the effects of sound on the marine environment (ESME) model incorporates a simulation program that permits fine-scale control over simulated marine animal (animat) movement and behavior. The simulation program, known as the Marine Mammal Movement and Behavior (3MB) module, provides user control over animats that is scaleable to available information about the species of concern. Movement and behavior is stochastically determined by sampling from distributions describing rates of movement in the horizontal and vertical planes, direction of travel, time at the surface between dives, time at depth, and time in and transition between behavioral states. Influence of behavior over each of the other distributions is permitted. As knowledge of marine animal behavior, movement, and ecology increases, the flexibility and level of control provided by such models will increase the potential for realistic impact estimates},

  abstract={Traditional approaches to the distributed simulation of digital designs are limited in that they are inefficient and prone to deadlock for systems with feedback loops. This paper proposes an asynchronous distributed algorithm to the simulation and verification of behavior-level models and describes its implementation on an actual loosely-coupled parallel processor. The approach is relatively efficient for realistic digital designs and mathematically shown to be deadlock free. Additionally, it includes a new technique for modeling the timing of digital systems that guarantees the accuracy of the simulation results. In the discipline of computer-aided design of digital systems, a behavior model refers to a compact and executable representation of the activities of a complex digital component or an entire digital system such as the Motorola 68000, expressed through a high-level hardware description language such as ADLIB or VHDL. Behavior models are popular because of their flexibility; however, they execute excruciatingly slow on uniprocessor computers. The approach presented in this paper has the potential to significantly reduce the execution time through concurrent execution on multiple processors.<>},

  abstract={In recent years, it is a difficult issue to integrate the deep cross-fertilization and interpretable cognitive modeling methods from the basic theory of emotional psychology with deep learning and other algorithms. To address this problem, a cognitive model that integrates the VGG-facial action coding system (FACS)-OCC model based on fer2013 expression features and the OCC-pleasure-arousal-dominance (PAD)-openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (OCEAN) fusion of the basic theory of emotional psychology, namely, a computational affection-based OCC-PAD-OCEAN federation cognitive modeling (OPO-FCM), is constructed. By constructing this model and performing formal proof algorithms, it is shown that the OPO-FCM can acquire expression features in video streams, complete the acquisition of expression features in videos by training a deep neural network, map expressions to the PAD emotion space through the established expression–basic emotions–emotion space mapping relationship, and finally complete the mapping of the average emotion over a period time. The information of personality space is obtained through it. Finally, the experimental simulation of the model is conducted, and the results show that the average accuracy of the valid tested personalities is 79.56%. This article takes the knowledge-driven approach of emotional psychology as a starting point and combines deep learning techniques to construct interpretable cognitive models, thus providing new ideas for future cross-innovation between computer technology and psychology theory.},

  abstract={In this paper, a novel distributed small-signal heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) model at millimeter-wave frequencies is proposed. This new approach integrates the electromagnetic (EM) simulation of the outer extrinsic passive part of an HBT, the coupled transmission lines for the fingers, and the Gupta multiport connection into an efficient global distributed modeling approach. For the first time, the values of the entire HBT intrinsic model elements used in the active elementary cells (AECs) can subsequently be extracted through the explicit analytical expressions derived through the multiport connection method. Good agreement between the measured and the simulated results has been demonstrated. This model has several unique advantages for microwave transistor optimization and synthesis in that the derived explicit analytical expressions are in terms of the effect of the extrinsic parts, allowing the designer to have better control over the whole transistor design. Furthermore, it serves as one of the valuable steps toward global modeling of millimeter-wave devices and circuits.},

  pages={68-78},
  abstract={The 1960s crossover model is widely applied to quantitatively predict a human controller's (HC's) manual control behavior. Unfortunately, the theory captures only compensatory tracking behavior and, as such, a limited range of real-world manual control tasks. This article finalizes recent advances in manual control theory toward more general pursuit and preview tracking tasks. It is quantified how HCs adapt their control behavior to a final crucial task variable: the target trajectory bandwidth. Beneficial adaptation strategies are first explored offline with computer simulations, using an extended crossover model theory for pursuit and preview tracking. The predictions are then verified with data from a human-in-the-loop experiment, in which participants tracked a target trajectory with bandwidths of 1.5, 2.5, and 4 rad/s, using compensatory, as well as pursuit and preview displays. In stark contrast to the crossover regression found in compensatory tasks, humans attenuate only their feedforward response when tracking higher-bandwidth trajectories in pursuit tasks, while their behavior is generally invariant in preview tasks. A full quantitative theory is now available to predict HC manual control behavior in tracking tasks, which includes HC adaptation to all key task variables.},

  year={2020},
  volume={67},
  number={9},
  pages={2572-2584},
  abstract={Objective: Multimodal measurements of the same phenomena provide complementary information and highlight different perspectives, albeit each with their own limitations. A focus on a single modality may lead to incorrect inferences, which is especially important when a studied phenomenon is a disease. In this paper, we introduce a method that takes advantage of multimodal data in addressing the hypotheses of disconnectivity and dysfunction within schizophrenia (SZ). Methods: We start with estimating and visualizing links within and among extracted multimodal data features using a Gaussian graphical model (GGM). We then propose a modularity-based method that can be applied to the GGM to identify links that are associated with mental illness across a multimodal data set. Through simulation and real data, we show our approach reveals important information about disease-related network disruptions that are missed with a focus on a single modality. We use functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion MRI (dMRI), and structural MRI (sMRI) to compute the fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF), fractional anisotropy (FA), and gray matter (GM) concentration maps. These three modalities are analyzed using our modularity method. Results: Our results show missing links that are only captured by the cross-modal information that may play an important role in disconnectivity between the components. Conclusion: We identified multimodal (fALFF, FA and GM) disconnectivity in the default mode network area in patients with SZ, which would not have been detectable in a single modality. Significance: The proposed approach provides an important new tool for capturing information that is distributed among multiple imaging modalities.},

The Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) simulation prove that NG complex with Al3+ metal exhibit the maximum current and the lowest turn-on voltage compared to the three NG materials with Co2+, Zn2+ and Fe3+ metals. In the endeavors to achieve better efficiency, we have optimized the OLED device based on Al3+ by improving the electron and hole injections.

  pages={701-714},
  abstract={We examined the hypothesis that aspects of processing that are most modifiable by experience (i.e., “plastic”) display the most vulnerability in developmental disorders and the most compensatory enhancement after sensory deprivation. A large literature reports that motion processing and magnocellular visual function is selectively deficient in dyslexia. A smaller literature reports enhancements in such functions in deaf individuals. However, studies with dyslexic and deaf individuals have used different experimental paradigms to assess visual function, and no research has yet examined both sides of modifiability (i.e., enhancements and deficits) using the same experimental paradigm. In the present research, visual function was compared in dyslexic (n = 15), deaf (n = 17), and control adults by using automated peripheral kinetic and foveal static perimetry. In the kinetic perimetry task, the dyslexic group showed deficits ( p < .003), whereas the deaf group showed enhancements ( p < .001) for detecting moving light points in the periphery. In the foveal static perimetry task, neither the dyslexic ( p = .866) nor the deaf ( p = .632) group differed significantly from controls in foveal contrast sensitivity thresholds, and no group or individual approached ceiling performance on this task. Taken together, the present data bridge previous literatures and suggest that motion processing tasks are selectively modifiable, either to decrement or enhancement, whereas foveal contrast sensitivity does not differ in dyslexic or deaf groups.},

This article examines the learning interfaces for pedagogical virtual reality (VR) environments, including immersive VR (iVR). It also looks at how microlearning (ML) can be employed for instructional design at the sticking points of these interfaces. ML is an approach in which learning materials are provided in small bite-sized quantities and has been embraced as an ideal learning format for the modern learner. This study explores the research gap in ML literature regarding the ideal length of materials and modality when ML is employed for iVR. It does so through two experiments: in the first, students gave feedback on different interfaces for content and in the second, different lengths of text, video, and presentation style were tested for optimal user preference and comprehension. The findings show that preferences must be balanced against expected learning outcomes or desired level of engagement, but that fixed-point interfaces and longer texts may best be avoided. The study can be used to inform technology-enhanced learning delivery and can be used to guide policy regarding effective digital content, particularly within a VR environment.},

  abstract={Decades of heavy investment in laboratory-based brain imaging and neuroscience have led to foundational insights into how humans sense, perceive, and interact with the external world. However, it is argued that fundamental differences between laboratory-based and naturalistic human behavior may exist. Thus, it remains unclear how well the current knowledge of human brain function translates into the highly dynamic real world. While some demonstrated successes in real-world neurotechnologies are observed, particularly in the area of brain-computer interaction technologies, innovations and developments to date are limited to a small science and technology community. We posit that advancements in real-world neuroimaging tools for use by a broad-based workforce will dramatically enhance neurotechnology applications that have the potential to radically alter human–system interactions across all aspects of everyday life. We discuss the efforts of a joint government-academic-industry team to take an integrative, interdisciplinary, and multi-aspect approach to translate current technologies into devices that are truly fieldable across a range of environments. Results from initial work, described here, show promise for dramatic advances in the field that will rapidly enhance our ability to assess brain activity in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract={Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) often exhibit impairments in communication and social interaction, and thus face various social challenges in collaborative activities. Given the cost of ASD intervention and lack of access to trained clinicians, technology-assisted ASD intervention has gained momentum in recent years. In this paper, we present a novel collaborative virtual environment (CVE)-based social interaction platform for ASD intervention. The development of CVE technology for ASD intervention may lead to the creation of a novel low-cost intervention environment that will foster collaboration with peers and provide flexibility in communication. The presented Communication-Enhancement CVE system, hand-in-hand, allows two children to play a series of interactive games in a virtual reality environment by using simple hand gestures to collaboratively move virtual objects that are tracked in real time via cameras. Furthermore, these games are designed to promote natural communication and cooperation between the users via the presented Communication-Enhancement mode that allows users to share information and discuss game strategies using gaze and voice-based communication. The results of a feasibility study with 12 children with ASD and 12 typically developing peers show that this system was well accepted by both the children with and without ASD, improved their cooperation in game play, and demonstrated the potential for fostering their communication and collaboration skills.},

  abstract={Large-scale group decision-making (LSGDM), which involves dozens to hundreds of decision-makers (DMs), is attracting extensive attention and has become an interesting and hot topic in recent years. Because of various backgrounds and expression habits, DMs tend to elicit preferences with different preference representation structures. Moreover, due to various attitudes and interests, some DMs may adopt noncooperative behaviors to further benefit themselves in LSGDM. To cope with these issues, this study develops an adaptive consensus framework to support heterogeneous LSGDM. A cosine similarity based optimization model is constructed and its analytical solution is derived to directly obtain the collective priority vector of the group using heterogeneous preferences. An extended k-means algorithm is then used to classify DMs. Subsequently, a two-stage uninorm-based behavior management method is developed to generate personalized weight feedback to each DM and subcluster according to their cooperative and noncooperative degrees in the consensus-reaching process. Finally, an illustrative example followed by simulation and comparative analyses is provided to reveal the advantages and features of the proposed approach.},

The developed neural network was trained based on a large volume of data samples of real-life pedestrian walking behavior (3813 training samples) to acquire knowledge of pedestrian walking behavior and to develop the ability to predict microscopic pedestrian walking behavior. A quantitative evaluation index, R-squared, was calculated to evaluate the learning performance; the mean was calculated as 0.900, which indicates that the neural network can well capture the underlying decision-making mechanism behind pedestrian walking behavior. The approach was verified by the prediction of microscopic pedestrian walking behavior details in two real-life scenarios. The vector displacement error and the speed error were calculated to evaluate the quality of the prediction; the mean of the vector displacement error (the speed error) in two scenarios were, respectively, calculated as 0.192 (0.116) and 0.226 (0.096), which indicates that the prediction results were acceptable from an engineering perspective. Based on these results, we consider the developed approach to be capable of predicting microscopic pedestrian walking behavior. Moreover, extended application also shows that the proposed approach has promise for simulation of the short-term flow of a pedestrian crowd.},

  abstract={Cloud gaming has emerged as a promising approach to more affordable and accessible games. By rendering high-end video games in the cloud and streaming encoded game scenes to players via the broadband networks, users are relieved from downloading or installing game software. With cloud gaming, users can easily play high-end 3-D video games on any devices anytime and anywhere. In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive measurement study of a leading cloud gaming system in China, namely, CloudUnion. Unlike the previous work, our measurement study was based on an in-depth understanding of the internal mechanisms of CloudUnion, and thus we were able to reveal problems that cannot be observed in a black-box approach. We built a dedicated measurement platform, which enables us to study CloudUnion from different views, including the global view, local view, and user view. We also conducted a comparison study with another cloud gaming system, namely, GamingAnywhere. Our measurement results unveil the pros and cons of the current cloud gaming system design, and bring forth important insights about the cloud infrastructure, user behaviors, traffic patterns, user-perceived quality, and so on. Our work will be valuable for the design of future cloud gaming systems.},

  abstract={Accurate and simple magnetic material behavior law is necessary to correctly model complete electromagnetic systems. In this paper, a new formulation based on the scalar quasi-static hysteresis Preisach model extended to dynamic behavior using fractional derivation dynamic contribution is proposed. The fractional contribution is solved using convolution which highly reduces the numerical issues. The order of the fractional derivation provides a new degree of freedom and allows to correctly obtain simulation results on a very large frequency bandwidth. By using such formulation, space discretization techniques (finite differences, finite elements) are avoided which are highly space and time consuming while keeping the global simulation results precise. The numerical implementation of the problem and some experimental validations are shown in this paper.},

  pages={189-205},
  abstract={This paper investigates two noncooperative-game strategies which may be used to represent a human driverʼ s steering control behavior in response to vehicle automated steering intervention. The first strategy, namely the Nash strategy is derived based on the assumption that a Nash equilibrium is reached in a noncooperative game of vehicle path-following control involving a driver and a vehicle automated steering controller. The second one, namely the Stackelberg strategy is derived based on the assumption that a Stackelberg equilibrium is reached in a similar context. A simulation study is performed to study the differences between the two proposed noncooperative-game strategies. An experiment using a fixed-base driving simulator is carried out to measure six test driversʼ steering behavior in response to vehicle automated steering intervention. The Nash strategy is then fitted to measured driver steering wheel angles following a model identification procedure. Control weight parameters involved in the Nash strategy are identified. It is found that the proposed Nash strategy with the identified control weights is capable of representing the trend of measured driver steering behavior and vehicle lateral responses. It is also found that the proposed Nash strategy is superior to the classic driver steering control strategy which has widely been used for modeling driver steering control over the past. A discussion on improving automated steering control using the gained knowledge of driver noncooperative-game steering control behavior was made.},

  pages={1058-1073},
  abstract={The existing thermal behavior analysis mainly focuses on the normal condition of converter but lacks investigation in the cases of faulty condition and modulation strategy switching. This further leads to inaccuracy and incomprehensive thermal management. In order to address this issue, in this article, a mixed-logical-dynamic (MLD)-based electrothermal model is proposed for a fast observation of the thermal behavior of power devices within converters under both normal case and open-circuit (OC) fault cases. It also has the advantage of applicability to various modulation strategies. To be specific, the switching-logic-mixed (SLM) and transition-logic-mixed (TLM) variables are first defined to analyze the generating conditions of power loss in power modules, where the power loss models considering the normal and OC fault cases are built, after which the MLD-based electrothermal model is established to calculate the junction temperature of power modules, which will be used to obtain the thermal behaviors of converters. Finally, under various OC fault cases, the thermal behavior of traction converters is analyzed by hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) real-time simulation test. The HIL-based results show that the proposed model can be used to analyze the thermal behaviors under various scenarios in real time, which can further offer guidance for thermal management under faulty conditions.},

  pages={12241-12254},
  abstract={Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)-based forward collision warning is a core connected vehicle (CV) service for preventing traffic crashes. Since the driver’s reaction affects the surrounding traffic conditions, an analysis of the effects of the CV application is required in terms of traffic stream performance. This study compared the differences in driving behaviors of CVs depending on whether V2V-based forward collision warning information was provided. The driving characteristics of CVs based on the analysis of probe vehicle data (PVD) were defined, and a methodology was proposed to simulate the driving behaviors of CVs in VISSIM environments. Additionally, the effectiveness of improving mobility and traffic safety by various market penetration rates (MPRs) of CVs in an accident situation was identified by evaluating the average travel speed and time-to-collision (TTC)-based crash risk. The simulation results for the two-lane blocking accident scenario indicated that the average speed increased by 23.18% with an MPR of 100%, and the TTC-based crash risk decreased by 18.34% compared with an MPR of 0%. It has been demonstrated that V2V-based warning information is useful for not only safety benefits but also mobility improvement. The results of this study could be employed as fundamentals to establish various policies to expedite the implementation of CV systems in practice. In addition, it is suggested that the outcome of this study will be useful for developing traffic flow management strategies technology to improve traffic safety.},

  abstract={Educational video games are increasingly present in the classroom. While their success as a learning tool has been demonstrated in technical fields, they have been little used in the arts. Plays, for example, would be excellent subjects for video games, as they are similar in terms of design and narrative. However, few video games are based on plays, and, of those that have been created, their effectiveness has yet to be proven. This material is limited due to the difficulty of the narrative change, distancing a play, which is linear-without interactivity- from a video game, in which the plot varies to allow interaction. This article details the creation of a video game as an interestraising tool, based on the work of Lope de Vega's The Courtesy of Spain, in collaboration with the National Company of Classical Theater (CNTC). CNTC's main objective is to engage Spain's youth in classical theater, increasing their motivation and desire to learn more. This project includes an experiment in a school in Madrid with 154 students, between 9 and 11 years. The experiment indicates that a video game based on a play not only stimulates interest in young people, but also helps broader learning processes.},

There are essentially two simulation strategies: (1) using an approximation method (e.g., Runge-Kutta) with spike times binned to the time step and (2) calculating spike times exactly in an event-driven fashion. In large networks, the computation time of the best algorithm for either strategy scales linearly with the number of synapses, but each strategy has its own assets and constraints: approximation methods can be applied to any model but are inexact; exact simulation avoids numerical artifacts but is limited to simple models. Previous work has focused on improving the accuracy of approximation methods. In this article, we extend the range of models that can be simulated exactly to a more realistic model: an integrate-and-fire model with exponential synaptic conductances.},

  abstract={Top management teams (TMTs) play an important role in enterprises. How to improve the cooperation of TMTs in the process of the mixed ownership reform of state-owned enterprise is a new era theme and currently a key objective in China. In this paper, we use evolutionary game theory to research the dynamic behavior of TMTs from the perspective of knowledge input and knowledge flow. We construct the evolutionary game model from the dimensions of knowledge input, knowledge flow, cooperation costs, government reward, and government penalty firstly, then we explore the strategy selection on knowledge input or not in the cooperation of TMTs between state-owned enterprise and private enterprise. Finally, we discuss the model's local stability and perform a simulation analysis of the factors that can influence the stability of the model. The results show that the final strategy choices of TMTs between two parties are related to not only the initial payment matrix constructed but also the selection of the initial parameters of the partners: Under different situations, the strategy evolution result will be stable at (input, not input), (not input, input) and (input, input). Increasing the degree of knowledge flow, government reward, and government penalty and reducing the cooperation costs between state-owned enterprise and private enterprise can promote the TMTs' cooperation in the process of the mixed ownership reform. Based on the conclusions, we put forward relevant suggestions for enterprises and the government. We hope that this research can provide some sustainable solutions to improve the cooperation of the TMTs between state-owned and private enterprise.},

  abstract={We propose a model that combines existing walking and crowd models (the social-force, following behavior, and Boids models) to simulate pedestrian flow under realistic states of congestion. We recorded pedestrians walking in a passage inside Shinagawa Station to capture the actual conditions and compared this with our simulation results to verify the reliability of the existing and proposed models. This confirmed that the proposed model could reproduce actual pedestrian flow better than the existing models. Using the verified proposed model, we examined the number of rows deep in which pedestrians can comfortably walk down a crowded passage. We then calculated the magnitude of the average number of people leaving as well as their walking speed depending on the number of rows deep in which the pedestrians walked. This analysis confirmed that pedestrians could comfortably walk down a passage that is 16-m wide by 64-m long when there are only two or three rows of pedestrian flow.},

  pages={1094-1106},
  abstract={We report here two cases of two young diplegic patients with cystic periventricular leukomalacia who systematically, and with high sensitivity, perceive translational motion of a random-dot display in the opposite direction. The apparent inversion was specific for translation motion: Rotation and expansion motion were perceived correctly, with normal sensitivity. It was also specific for random-dot patterns, not occurring with gratings. For the one patient that we were able to test extensively, contrast sensitivity for static stimuli was normal, but was very low for direction discrimination at high spatial frequencies and all temporal frequencies. His optokinetic nystagmus movements were normal but he was unable to track a single translating target, indicating a perceptual origin of the tracking deficit. The severe deficit for motion perception was also evident in the seminatural situation of a driving simulation video game. The perceptual deficit for translational motion was reinforced by functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. Translational motion elicited no response in the MT complex, although it did produce a strong response in many visual areas when contrasted with blank stimuli. However, radial and rotational motion produced a normal pattern of activation in a subregion of the MT complex. These data reinforce the existent evidence for independent cortical processing for translational, and circular or radial flow motion, and further suggest that the two systems have different vulnerability and plasticity to prenatal damage. They also highlight the complexity of visual motion perception, and how the delicate balance of neural activity can lead to paradoxical effects such as consistent misperception of the direction of motion. We advance a possible explanation of a reduced spatial sampling of the motion stimuli and report a simple model that simulates well the experimental results.},

  abstract={Widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) would significantly increase the overall electrical load demand in power distribution networks. Hence, there is a need for comprehensive planning of charging infrastructure in order to prevent power failures or scenarios where there is a considerable demand-supply mismatch. Accurately predicting the realistic charging demand of EVs is an essential part of the infrastructure planning. Charging demand of EVs is influenced by several factors, such as driver behavior, location of charging stations, electricity pricing, etc. In order to implement an optimal charging infrastructure, it is important to consider all the relevant factors that influence the charging demand of EVs. Several studies have modeled and simulated the charging demands of individual and groups of EVs. However, in many cases, the models do not consider factors related to the social characteristics of EV drivers. Other studies do not emphasize on economic elements. This paper aims at evaluating the effects of the above factors on EV charging demand using a simulation model. An agent-based approach using NetLogo is employed in this paper to closely mimic the human aggregate behavior and its influence on the load demand due to charging of EVs.},

Subjects trained for 13 sessions, 30 min per session, three sessions per week, and had no conventional outpatient therapy. Computerized measures of performance showed group effects in hand mechanical energy (1200% for the virtual ball squeezing and DigiKey exercises and 600% for the power putty exercise). Improvement in their hand function was also observed (a 38% reduction in virtual pegboard errors, and 70% fewer virtual hand ball errors). Clinical strength measures showed increases in grip (by up to 150%) and key pinch (up to 46%) strength in three of the subjects, while two subjects had decreased strength following the study. However, all five subjects improved in their tip pinch strength of their affected hand (between 20%-267%). When asked whether they would recommend the virtual reality exercises to others, four subjects very strongly agreed and one strongly agreed that they would},

  abstract={In this paper, a case-supported principle-based behavior paradigm is proposed to help ensure ethical behavior of autonomous machines. We argue that ethically significant behavior of autonomous systems should be guided by explicit ethical principles determined through a consensus of ethicists. Such a consensus is likely to emerge in many areas in which autonomous systems are apt to be deployed and for the actions they are liable to undertake. We believe that this is the case since we are more likely to agree on how machines ought to treat us than on how human beings ought to treat one another. Given such a consensus, particular cases of ethical dilemmas where ethicists agree on the ethically relevant features and the right course of action can be used to help discover principles that balance these features when they are in conflict. Such principles not only help ensure ethical behavior of complex and dynamic systems but also can serve as a basis for justification of this behavior. The requirements, methods, implementation, and evaluation components of the paradigm are detailed as well as its instantiation in both a simulated and real robot functioning in the domain of eldercare.},

The research presented here combines mathematical modeling and computer simulation in developing a new model of the membrane polarization induced in the myocardium by the applied electric field. Employing this new model termed the "periodic" bidomain model, the steady-state distribution of the transmembrane potential is calculated on a slice of cardiac tissue composed of abutting myocytes and subjected to two point-source extracellular current stimuli. The goal of this study is to examine the relative contribution of cellular discreteness and macroscopic syncytial tissue behavior in the mechanism by which the applied electric field alters the transmembrane potential in cardiac muscle. The results showed the existence of oscillatory changes in the transmembrane potential at cell ends owing to the local resistive inhomogeneities (gap-junctions). This low-magnitude sawtooth component in the transmembrane potential is superimposed over large-scale transmembrane potential excursions associated with the syncytial (collective) fiber behavior. The character of the cardiac response to stimulation is determined primarily by the large-scale syncytial tissue behavior. The sawtooth contributes to the overall tissue response only in regions where the large-scale transmembrane potential component is small.},

In this study, laser ultrasonic measurements and finite-element numerical simulations are used to investigate the dispersion behavior of BW-ASF modes. It was found that a BW-ASF mode arises as a result of mode coupling between two LW-ASF modes of the same order corresponding to the two apex angles of the BW.},

  pages={1320-1330},
  abstract={This paper presents a novel method for fast and optimal determination of recruitment (input–output, IO) curve parameters in neural stimulation. A sequential parameter estimation (SPE) method was developed based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM), with a stopping rule based on successively satisfying a specified estimation tolerance. Simulated motor responses evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were used as a test bed. Performance of FIM-SPE was characterized in 10 177 simulation runs for various IO parameter values corresponding to different virtual subjects, compared with uniform sampling. Unlike uniform sampling, FIM-SPE identifies and samples the areas of the IO curve that contain maximum information about the curve parameters. For the most relaxed stopping rule, the median number of samples required for convergence was only 17 for FIM-SPE versus 294 for uniform sampling. For the highest reliability stopping rule, more than 92% of the FIM-SPE runs converged, with a median of 88 samples, whereas all uniform sampling runs reached 1000 samples without converging.

  abstract={Network simulation is a fundamental service for performance testing and protocol design in wireless networks. Due to the wireless dynamics, it is highly challenging to provide repeatable and reliable simulation results that are comparable to the empirical experimental results. To achieve repeatability for simulation, the existing works focus on reproducing the behaviors on individual links. However, as observed in recent works, individual link behaviors alone are far from enough to characterize the protocol-level performance. As a result, even if the link behaviors can be simulated very closely, these works often fail to simulate the protocol performance with high reliability. In this article, we propose a novel performance-aware simulation approach which can preserve not only the link-level behaviors but also the performance-level behaviors. We first combine the spatial-temporal link diversity to devise an accurate performance model. Based on the model, we then propose a Performance Aware Hidden Markov Model (PA-HMM), where the protocol performance is directly fed into the Markov state transitions. Compared to the existing works, PA-HMM is able to simulate both link-level behaviors and high-level protocol performance. We conduct extensive testbed and simulation experiments with broadcast and anycast protocols. The results show that 1) the proposed model is able to accurately characterize communication performance for both broadcast and anycast and 2) the protocol performance is closely simulated as compared to the empirical results and the PA-HMM based simulation is more repeatable compared to the existing works.},

  abstract={Discrete event simulation is a methodology to study the behavior of complex systems. Its drawback is that, in order to get reliable results, simulations usually have to be run over a long stretch of time. This time requirement could decrease through the usage of parallel or distributed computing systems. In this paper, we analyze the Time Warp synchronization protocol for parallel discrete event simulation and present an analytical model evaluating the upper bound on the completion time of a Time Warp simulation. In our analysis, we consider the case of a simulation model with homogeneous logical processes, where "homogeneous" means they have the same average event routine time and the same state saving cost. Then we propose a methodology to determine when it is time-convenient to use a Time Warp synchronized simulation, instead of a sequential one, for a simulation model with features matching those considered in our analysis. We give an answer to this question without the need to preliminary generate the simulation code. Examples of methodology usage are reported for the case of both a synthetic benchmark and a real world model.},

  year={2016},

  pages={1005-1027},
  abstract={Nowadays, trust systems (TSs) are widely used for tackling dishonest entities in many modern environments. However, these systems are vulnerable to some kinds of attacks where attackers try to deceive the system using sequences of misleading behaviors and dishonest recommendations. A robust TS is expected to function properly even in the possibility of such attacks. To the best of our knowledge, simulation has been the main approach for evaluation of TSs so far, and there is no remarkable verification method for this aim. In this paper, a method for quantitative verification of TSs' robustness against malicious attackers is proposed. The proposed method consists of a formalism for specifying any given trust model named TS attack process that is cast into partially observable Markov decision process mathematical framework. The proposed method is capable of verifying TSs against both well-known attacks and the worst possible attack scenario. The method could also be used to help adjusting parameters of the given TS. Moreover, a quantitative robustness measure is introduced, which helps to compare the robustness of different TSs. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed method, a number of case studies for analysis and comparison of selected trust models (including Subjective Logic and REGRET) are presented.},

  pages={1450-1463},
  abstract={Modeling and simulation of cyber-physical devices is difficult because of their heterogeneity: they mix discrete-event (DE) hardware and software with continuous time (CT) physical processes. DEs simulation progresses by discrete timesteps while CT simulation does so in a time continuum; despite different time representations, data must be transmitted between both domains at precise points in time. Synchronizing these domains in an efficient and accurate manner is the core problem of CT and DEs simulation. As a design tool, SystemC AMS introduces a synchronization strategy that is based on fixed timesteps that proves useful for a large set of use cases. But this strategy generates inaccuracies that cannot be overcome without penalizing simulation speed. In this article, we propose a new CT and DEs synchronization algorithm on top of the SystemC framework and prove its causality, completeness, and liveness. We also propose an adaptive algorithm to adjust the synchronization step to provide near to optimum simulation speed. We test our solution with three demanding case studies that include nonlinear equations, Zeno behavior, and high sensitivity to accuracy errors. Results show that our algorithm circumvents these challenges, attains high accuracy with respect to established tools, and improves simulation speed. This work aims at enlarging the modeling and simulation capabilities of SystemC as a heterogeneous design tool.},

  number={9},
  pages={1637-1653},
  abstract={Stories transport readers into vivid imaginative worlds, but understanding how readers create such worlds???populating them with characters, objects, and events???presents serious challenges across disciplines. Auditory imagery is thought to play a prominent role in this process, especially when representing characters' voices. Previous research has shown that direct reference to speech in stories (e.g., He said, ???I'm over here???) may prompt spontaneous activation of voice-selective auditory cortex more than indirect speech [Yao, B., Belin, P., & Scheepers, C. Silent reading of direct versus indirect speech activates voice-selective areas in the auditory cortex. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 23, 3146???3152, 2011]. However, it is unclear whether this effect reflects differential processing of speech or differences in linguistic content, source memory, or grammar. One way to test this is to compare direct reference effects for characters speaking and thinking in a story. Here, we present a multidisciplinary fMRI study of 21 readers' responses to characters' speech and thoughts during silent reading of short fictional stories. Activations relating to direct and indirect references were compared for both speaking and thinking. Eye-tracking and independent localizer tasks (auditory cortex and theory of mind [ToM]) established ROIs in which responses to stories could be tracked for individuals. Evidence of elevated auditory cortex responses to direct speech over indirect speech was observed, replicating previously reported effects; no reference effect was observed for thoughts. Moreover, a direct reference effect specific to speech was also evident in regions previously associated with inferring intentions from communication. Implications are discussed for the spontaneous representation of fictional characters and the potential roles of inner speech and ToM in this process.},

  abstract={Mechanisms promoting the evolution of cooperation in two players and two strategies (22) evolutionary games have been investigated in great detail over the past decades. Understanding the effects of repeated interactions in multiplayer spatial games, however, is a formidable challenge. In this paper, we present a multiplayer evolutionary game model in which agents play iterative games in spatial populations. -player versions of the well-known Prisoner's Dilemma and the Snowdrift games are used as the basis of the investigation. These games were chosen as they have emerged as the most promising mathematical metaphors for studying cooperative phenomena. Here, we have adopted an experimental approach to study the emergent behavior, exploring different parameter configurations via numerical simulations. Key model parameters include the cost-to-benefit ratio, the size of groups, the number of repeated encounters, and the interaction topology. Our simulation results reveal that, while the introduction of iterated interactions does promote higher levels of cooperative behavior across a wide range of parameter settings, the cost-to-benefit ratio and group size are important factors in determining the appropriate length of beneficial repeated interactions. In particular, increasing the number of iterated interactions may have a detrimental effect when the cost-to-benefit ratio and group size are small.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a novel method for the machine learning-based online prediction of generator dynamic behavior in large interconnected power systems. Unlike the existing literature in this domain, which assumes faults occur immediately after a steady-state situation, the proposed method takes the possibility of multiple disturbances into account. It is founded on a simulation-based classification approach to indirectly take advantage of phasor measurement unit (PMU) data, which leads to improvements in robustness against load model uncertainties. Relying on offline scenarios, the method developed conducts multiple time-domain simulations (TDSs) in parallel for a set of feasible two-machine dynamic equivalent models (DEMs) for each case. Thereafter, common descriptive statistics are computed for the rotor angles obtained to form the feature space. The values taken via a feature selection process are then applied as inputs to ensemble decision trees, which train models capable of predicting both stability status and generator grouping ahead of time. In online situations, PMU data are used to create DEMs and the predictors are collected by performing parallel TDSs for DEMs. The functionality of the proposed hybrid machine learning and TDS-based approach is verified on several IEEE test systems, followed by a discussion of results.},

  abstract={Plasma and fluid behavior in a nonequilibrium disk magnetohydrodynamics generator with multiple loading has been investigated with a time-dependent three-dimensional numerical simulation. Particular attention is paid to the effects of the downstream load resistance and the influences of the middle electrode on the plasma and fluid flow. The possibility to improve generator performance by multiple-loading operation is also examined. It is shown that increase in the downstream load resistance raises the static pressure and decelerates the working gas in the upstream region. This is because the static pressure increase and the boundary layer development near the middle electrode have the same effects as the change of the outlet boundary conditions for the upstream region. It is found that the ionization degree of seed atoms is kept high on the middle electrode, whereas, the electron temperature is decreased rapidly. This results from the longer relaxation time of ion number density compared to that of the electron temperature. The multiple-loading operation leads to an improvement of the enthalpy extraction ratio. Isentropic efficiency, however, becomes somewhat lower under the multiple-loading condition. This is caused by the high static pressure and the low electrical efficiency under the high enthalpy extraction condition for the multiple loading.},

  abstract={Human operator control of brain-actuated robot steering based on electroencephalograph (EEG)-signals is a complex behavior consisting of surroundings perceiving, decision making, and commands issuing and differs among individual operators. However, no existing models allow decoupling the user from the loop to improve the system design and testing process, which can capture such behavior of a brain-actuated robot. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose an operator brain-controlled steering model consisting of an operator decision model based on the queuing network (QN) cognitive architecture and a brain-machine interface (BMI) performance model. The QN-based operator decision model can mimic the human decision process with the individual operator differences considered. The new BMI performance model is built to represent the varied accuracy of BMI during brain-controlled direction operations. Furthermore, the model is simulated and validated against the results of human operator-in-the-loop experiments. The results show that the proposed model can reproduce the behavior of human operators thanks to its similar direction control performance.},

  abstract={This study analyzes the quench behavior of No-insulation (NI) REBCO pancake. An quench analysis simulation model considering the complex critical current density distribution was developed and validated experimentally. The developed model includes an equivalent circuit model, a thermal model, a magnetic model, and a magnet critical current estimation model. The simulation model is based on a co-simulation using MATLAB and COMSOL, considering the balance of accuracy and computation time. The lumped parameter of the NI magnet was used to solve the governing equations of the equivalent circuit module and thermal module in MATLAB. To accurately calculate the non-uniform electromagnetic field distribution over the coil, a magnetic finite element method was used in COMSOL. A neural network was used to predict the temperature-field-angle dependent magnet critical current. Considering the numerical convergence at different over-current phases, adaptive simulation was used to reduce the total simulation time. The quench behavior was analyzed using the proposed model, and the results were verified experimentally. The simulation results showed that when the azimuthal current is greater than the magnet critical current, it will gradually saturate and approach the magnet critical current, and then decrease at a similar speed. The rate of decrease is equal to the rate of decrease of the magnet critical current. Through the analyses, the corresponding sudden-discharging behavior was simulated and analyzed. The proposed model can be used to perform the post-quench and sudden discharging analyses of pancake coil and has promising applications in multi-pancake post-quench studies.},

  abstract={This article focuses on using deep reinforcement learning, specifically proximity policy optimization, to train agents in a social dilemma game, modified dictator game, in order to investigate the effect of selfishness and altruism on the believability of the game agents. We present the design and implementation of the training environment, including the reward functions which are based on the findings of established empirical research, with three agent profiles mapped to the three standard constant elasticity of substitution (CES) utility functions, i.e., selfish, perfect substitutes, and Leontief, which measure different levels of selfishness/altruism. The trained models are validated and then used in a sample game, which is used to evaluate the believability of the three agent profiles using the agent believability metrics. The results indicate that players find altruistic behaviour more believable and consider selfishness less so. Analysis of the results indicates that human-like behavior resulting from the application of artificial intelligence evolves from perceived human behavior rather than the observed. The analysis also indicates that selfishness/altruism may be considered as an extra dimension to be included in the believability metrics.},

  abstract={In this paper we propose a mechanism for motivational competition and selection of behavior. One important characteristic of this mechanism is that the selection of behavior is modelled as an emergent property of a parallel process. This in contrast with mechanisms for behavior selection and motivational competition proposed earlier, which are based on a hierarchical. preprogrammed control structure. We show that selection of behavior can be modeled in a bottom-up way using an activation/inhibition dynamics among the different behaviors that can be selected. There is no weighing up of behaviors in a cognitive manner and neither are hierarchical or bureaucratic structures imposed. The paper elaborates upon the results we obtained with simulated creatures based on this mechanism. It draws parallels between characteristics observed in animal behavior and characteristics demonstrated by our artificial creatures. Examples are: displacement behavior, opportunistic behavior, fatigue, selective attention, and so on.},

  pages={24474-24487},
  abstract={Realistic and diverse simulation scenarios with reactive and feasible agent behaviors can be used for validation and verification of self-driving system performance without relying on expensive and time-consuming real-world testing. Existing simulators rely on heuristic-based behavior models for background vehicles, which cannot capture the complex interactive behaviors in real-world scenarios. Meanwhile, existing learning-based methods are typical insufficient, yielding behaviors of traffic participants that frequently collide or drive off the road especially for a long horizon. To address this issue, we propose TrajGen, a two-stage trajectory generation framework, which can capture more realistic and diverse behaviors directly from human demonstration. In particular, TrajGen consists of the multi-modal trajectory prediction stage and the reinforcement learning based trajectory modification stage. In the first stage, we propose a novel auxiliary RouteLoss for the trajectory prediction model to generate multi-modal diverse trajectories in the drivable area. In the second stage, reinforcement learning is used to track the predicted trajectories while avoiding collisions, which can improve the reactivity and feasibility of generated trajectories. In addition, we develop a simulator I-Sim that can provide support for data-driven agent behavior simulation and train reinforcement learning models in parallel based on naturalistic driving data. The vehicle model in I-Sim can guarantee that the generated trajectories by TrajGen satisfy vehicle kinematic constraints. Finally, we give comprehensive metrics to evaluate generated trajectories for simulation scenarios, which shows that TrajGen outperforms either trajectory prediction or inverse reinforcement learning in terms of fidelity, reactivity, feasibility, and diversity.},

  abstract={An accurate and realistic brain tissue deformation model with real-time performance is very important for virtual neurosurgical simulation. In this paper, a new finite element method (FEM) brain tissue deformation model, which is based on the optimization implicit Euler method, is introduced. Biomechanical properties of brain tissue such as anisotropy and viscoelasticity are incorporated into the model, which provides more accurate and realistic imitation of the deformation of brain tissue. A descent method with GPU-based implementation is used to solve the optimization problem, which makes it possible to achieve a high degree of computational efficiency. Simulation results show that both the anisotropic and viscoelastic behaviors are presented in the deformation model. The GPU-based implementation of the proposed model significantly improves the computational efficiency over CPU-based FEM models with the implicit integration scheme. Moreover, the result of the proposed model converges to the exact solution of implicit Euler integration after 96 iterations. The proposed model was implemented on the development of a neurosurgical simulator. A relative high degree of realistic brain tissue deformation was rendered at a refreshment rate of 32.5 frames/s on a regular PC.},

  abstract={One goal of artificial intelligence (AI) research is to teach machines how to learn from humans, such that they can perform a certain task in a natural human-like way. In this article, an online adaptive inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) approach to human behavior modeling is proposed to enhance machine intelligence for a class of linear human-in-the-loop (HiTL) systems using the state data only, where the human behavior is described by a linear quadratic optimal control model with an unknown weighting matrix for the quadratic cost function. First, an integral concurrent adaptive law is developed to learn the human feedback gain matrix online using the demonstrated state data only, which removes the persistent excitation (PE) conditions required by traditional adaptive estimation approaches and thus is more in line with real applications. Then, with the learned feedback gain matrix, the IRL problem is formulated as a linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved to retrieve the weighting matrix of the human cost function. Finally, a simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract={The present work introduces an empirically ground agent-based modeling (ABM) framework to assess the spatial and temporal diffusion of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems on existing buildings of a city district. The overall ABM framework takes into account social, technical, environmental, and economic aspects to evaluate the diffusion of PV technology in the urban context. A city district that includes 18 720 households distributed over 1 290 building blocks and a surface area of 2.47 km2 is used to test the proposed ABM framework. Results show how the underlying regulatory framework (i.e., the rules of the internal electricity market) influences the pattern and intensity of adoption, thus realizing different shares of the available potential. Policies that support the establishment of `prosumers' within Condominiums (i.e., energy community buildings), and not in single-family houses only, is key to yield high diffusion rates. The installed capacity increases by 80% by switching from the one-to-one configuration to the one-to-many paradigm, i.e., from 5.90 MW of rooftop PV installed on single-family households and/or single PV owners to 10.64 MW in energy community buildings. Moreover, the possibility to spread the auto-generated solar electricity over the load profile of the entire population of Condominium results in self-consumption rates greater than 50% and self-sufficiency ratios above 20% for the majority of the simulated buildings.},

  pages={1243-1256},
  abstract={Automated understanding and recognition of human activities and behaviors in a smart space (e.g., smart house) is of paramount importance to many critical human-centered applications. Recognized activities are the input to the pervasive computer (the smart space) which intelligently interacts with the users to maintain the application's goal be it assistance, safety, child-development, entertainment or other goals. Research in this area is fascinating but severely lacks adequate validation which often relies on datasets that contain sensory data representing the activities. Availing adequate datasets that can be used in a large variety of spaces, for different user groups, and aiming at different goals is very challenging. This is due to the prohibitive cost and the human capital needed to instrument physical spaces and to recruit human subjects to perform the activities and generate data. Simulation of human activities in smart spaces has therefore emerged as an alternative approach to bridge this deficit. Traditional event-driven approaches have been proposed. However, the complexity of human activity simulation was proved to be challenging to these initial simulation efforts. In this paper, we present Persim 3D-an alternative context-driven approach to simulating human activities capable of supporting complex activity scenarios. We present the context-activity-action nexus and show how our approach combines modeling and visualization of actions with context and activity simulation. We present the Persim 3D architecture and algorithms, and describe a detailed validation study of our approach to verify the accuracy and realism of the simulation output (datasets and visualizations) and the scalability of the human effort in using Persim 3D to simulate complex scenarios. We show positive and promising results that validate our approach.},

  abstract={Drive cycle simulations of longitudinal vehicle models are important aids for the design and analysis of power trains, and tools currently on the market mainly use two different methods for such simulations: the forward dynamic and quasi-static inverse simulations. Here, a known theory for the stable inversion of nonlinear systems is used to combine the fast simulation times of the quasi-static inverse simulation with the ability of the forward dynamic simulation to include transient dynamics. The stable inversion technique and a new implicit driver model together form a new concept: inverse dynamic simulation. This technique is demonstrated to be feasible for vehicle propulsion simulation and specifically for three power train applications that include important dynamics that cannot be handled using quasi-static inverse simulation. The extensions are engine dynamics, driveline dynamics, and gas flow dynamics for diesel engines, which are also selected to represent important properties, such as zero dynamics, resonances, and nonminimum-phase systems. It is shown that inverse dynamic simulation is easy to set up, gives short simulation times, and gives consistent results for design space exploration. This makes inverse dynamic simulation a suitable method to use for drive cycle simulation, particularly in situations requiring many simulations, such as optimization over design space, power train configuration optimization, or the development of power train control strategies.},

  year={2023},
  volume={24},

  pages={9016-9030},
  abstract={Path dispersion (the spatial distribution of vehicular paths) is an important feature of traffic flow inside intersections and differs from traffic flow running along traffic lanes at road segment, especially under conflicting movements. The path dispersion reflects the operational features of traffic flow and is related to driving behaviour, arrival flow patterns, layout design, and the traffic control and management scheme. This study aims to improve the understanding of the overall path dispersion of unprotected left-turns and the opposing through movement. A behavioural simulation model was established to represent the overall path dispersion. Human behaviours regarding vehicle trajectory planning with and without conflicting vehicles were modelled based on optimal control and integrated into the proposed discrete event simulation framework. The descriptive power and accuracy of the proposed simulation model were validated using empirical data. The effects of the spatial size of the intersection, crossing angle, and traffic volume on the path dispersion of the left-turn and through movement were explored based on numerical experiments. The results show that the proposed simulation model can represent the path dispersion of left-turn and opposing through movement well for both the calibrated intersections and newly added intersections without model parameter recalibration with an average error of 8.92%.},

  pages={3451-3455},
  abstract={Multi-scale modeling has become a productive strategy for quantifying interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) network structure–function relationships, but the lack of large-scale ICC network imaging data currently limits modeling progress. The single normal equation simulation (SNESIM) algorithm was utilized to generate realistic virtual images of small real wild-type (WT) and 5-HT$_{2B}$-receptor knockout (Htr2b$^{-/-}$) mice ICC networks. Two metrics were developed to validate the performance of the algorithm: 1) network density, which is the proportion of ICC in the tissue; and 2) connectivity, which reflects the degree of connectivity of the ICC network. Following validation, the SNESIM algorithm was modified to allow variation in the degree of ICC network depletion. ICC networks from a range of depletion severities were generated, and the electrical activity over these networks was simulated. The virtual ICC networks generated by the original SNESIM algorithm were similar to that of their real counterparts. The electrical activity simulations showed that the maximum current density magnitude increased as the network density increased. In conclusion, the SNESIM algorithm is an effective tool for generating realistic virtual ICC networks. The modified SNESIM algorithm can be used with simulation techniques to quantify the physiological consequences of ICC network depletion at various physical scales.},

  pages={2288-2298},
  abstract={Developing effective strategies for redirected walking requires extensive evaluations across a variety of factors that influence performance. Because these large-scale experiments are often not practical with user studies, researchers have instead utilized simulations to systematically test different algorithm parameters, physical space configurations, and virtual walking paths. Although simulation offers an efficient way to evaluate redirected walking algorithms, it remains an open question whether this evaluation methodology is ecologically valid. In this paper, we investigate the interaction between locomotion behavior and redirection gains at a micro-level (across small path segments) and macro-level (across an entire experience). This examination involves analyzing data from real users and comparing algorithm performance metrics with a simulated user model. The results identify specific properties of user locomotion behavior that influence the application of redirected walking gains and resets. Overall, we found that the simulation provided a conservative estimate of the average performance with real users and observed that performance trends when comparing two redirected walking algorithms were preserved. In general, these results indicate that simulation is an empirically valid evaluation methodology for redirected walking algorithms.},

  abstract={This paper presents calculation results of time-varying behavior of no-insulation (NI) high temperature superconductor (HTS) field coil for synchronous motor considering armature reaction and slotting effect. We selected four NI HTS motor models having different stator topologies for confirmation of armature reaction and slotting effect. Also, before NI behavior analysis, we proposed a wound field synchronous motor (WFSM) dq-equivalent circuit which can be considered as a circuit model of insulated (INS) HTS motor. The circuit model used in this paper contains parameters varying with the position of rotor and dq-axes cross-coupling inductance for describing the armature reaction and slotting effect of practical motor. Next, to investigate time-varying behavior of NI field coil during steady-state operation, simulations of a new circuit model combining proposed dq-equivalent circuit and NI lumped circuit were implemented. Turn to turn radial leak current values of selected models were calculated at different armature current density. Also, torque ripple values of the NI and the INS case were obtained by circuit simulations. It can be confirmed that peak to peak radial current occurs by largest value at the topology having the greatest flux linkage harmonics and torque ripple value of NI motor is smaller than that of INS HTS motor.},

  abstract={Both nondeterminism and multilevel networks can be used to compactly characterize logic structures as well as all the flexibilities allowed for optimizing them. Synthesis results can be improved by allowing the manipulation of a larger class of networks called nondeterministic (ND) networks. These are multilevel logic networks that embody both nondeterminism and multivalued (MV) signals and, thus, enhance compactness and expressiveness. In this paper, a complete theory for representing and manipulating ND networks is developed. It is shown that an ND network's behavior can be classified into at least three types, all of which coalesce when the network becomes deterministic. The theory addresses the classical transformations commonly applied to optimize deterministic binary networks, such as node minimization, elimination, and decomposition. These are analyzed with respect to their effects on each type of network behavior, leading to modifications of some operations to make them safe, i.e., guaranteeing that the new behavior remains within the network's specification. Finally, it is proved that all three types of behaviors can be used in a hierarchical-synthesis paradigm},

  abstract={Gamification, commonly described as the use of game design elements in nongame contexts, is frequently adopted to enhance users' motivation, engagement, and happiness while supporting them in reaching different objectives, related to learning activities and behavioral changes. Despite being a widely used approach, several studies show that the final outcomes following gamification use are not always positive. To face this problem, we developed a tool called GamiDOC composed of different features aimed at facing the existing problems in the gameful systems design process and, at the same time, guiding designers and practitioners in the design and evaluation of gamified solutions. In this article, we present the elements that make gameful systems design a challenging process, the state of the art in gamification design, and the issues that are still open in the design of gameful systems. Finally, we provide a detailed description of GamiDOC and why the tool stands as a valuable solution to guide users across all the stages of gameful systems design, development, and evaluation. Finally, we present a usability evaluation of GamiDOC and a use-case scenario.},

  abstract={In order to remain viable and to reproduce an animal has to continuously deal with the problem of choosing the right behavior among several others (e.g. obtaining food, obtaining water, avoiding predators, ...) at the right time. In robotics this problem arises when we want to synthesize a complex behavior from elementary behaviors. Within the reinforcement learning framework we review the behaviors coordination methods proposed so far. Then we discuss their limitations and propose a new coordination method based on the restless bandits theory. Restless bandits allocation indexes are an extension of the Gittins indexes and are borrowed from the field of optimal scheduling. They concern problems involving the sharing of limited resources between several projects which are being pursued. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated through the postman robot problem and compared to the Hierarchical Q-learning (Lin, 1993).},

  abstract={It has long been recognized that changes in neural activity within an organism's brain may cause specific changes in its behavior. However, much less is known about the specific role of self-generated movement and of behavioral interactions with an environment in the development of complex neuronal properties. To address this question, we designed Darwin V, which consists of a simulated neuronal model embedded in a real world device capable of autonomous behavior. The model has four major components: a visual system incorporating several key properties of mammalian visual cortex, a taste system based on conductance, sets of motor neurons capable of triggering behavior, and a diffuse ascending (value) system. As Darwin V encounters stimulus objects in its environment, synaptic modifications within its visual maps produce pattern-selective and translation invariant neuronal responses. Due to value-dependent synaptic modifications in sensorimotor connections, visual neurons become linked to motor neurons triggering appropriate behaviors. Closer analysis reveals that the acquisition of translation invariance depends critically upon continuous self-generated movements of Darwin V. In addition, the allocation of map areas selective for particular stimulus classes depends upon frequency and historical sequence of stimulus encounters. In summary, the analysis of Darwin V provides several examples for the role of environment and behavior in the development of complex neuronal responses.},
