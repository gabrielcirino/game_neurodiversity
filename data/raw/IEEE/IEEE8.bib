  abstract={Here we describe a vision of VR games that combine the best features of gaming and VR: large, persistent worlds experienced in photorealistic settings with full immersion. For example, Figure 1 illustrates a hypothetical immersive VR game that could be developed using current technologies, including real-time, cinematic-quality graphics; a panoramic head-mounted display (HMD); and wide-area tracking. We also examine the gap between available VR and gaming technologies, and offer solutions for bridging it.},

  title={Reasons and Responses: A Multimodal Serious Games Evaluation Framework}, 
  year={2020},
  volume={8},

  pages={245-255},
  abstract={Evaluation is an essential part of any software development process as it helps compare intended with actual outcomes and identify possible improvements. To do this, it is important to understand how users interact with the product. As interactions with the interdisciplinary product category of Serious Games can be multifaceted, pure text-logging of gameplay actions is not always sufficient to cover all aspects needed to satisfy researchers' needs, for instance how the user feels or what s/he thinks while carrying out a certain action. For this reason, studies evaluating serious games are increasingly applying multimodal methods in recent years. This makes it important to establish theoretical foundations considering the changing research landscape. This paper presents a theoretical framework for multimodal Serious Games evaluation based on a review of relevant research.},

  pages={737-759},
  abstract={This paper concerns how intelligent systems should be designed to make adequate, valuable and natural affective interventions. The article proposes a process for choosing an affective intervention model for an intelligent system. The process consists of 10 activities that allow for step-by-step design of an affective feedback loop and takes into account the following factors: expected and desired emotional states, characteristics of the system and available input channels for emotion recognition. The proposed method is supported with three examples of intelligent systems that have used the process to design or to describe affective intervention. Two of them are case studies of affective video games that were designed with the proposed approach and evaluated against the non-affective versions. Another example described in the article is the affective tutoring system Gerda, which exemplifies a more complex and sophisticated intervention model.},

  abstract={Traditional safety training media to transfer safety knowledge specific to the rock-related hazards in underground mines are mainly video or manuals, which are inefficient and bring a poor training experience. In this paper, we designed and developed a serious game based on virtual reality (VR) technology in order to efficiently transfer safety knowledge and enable enhanced interactive safety training. For different training purposes and users, we designed two modes, one for professional scaling training suitable for novice scalers, the other for rock-related hazards perception training suitable for other miners. Our game is built based on game engine-Unity3D and equipped with HTC VIVE to improve immersion. The game pipeline is to have trainees basically understand safety knowledge through guided interaction and then make a self-adaptive practice to fully master it. We evaluated the effectiveness of our game, and the results of the comparative experiment show that our game is more efficient than the instructional video in both training modes. The application of our game is proven to have the potential to change the safety situation of underground mines and evaluate the level of safety awareness and risk aversion of the miners in the future.},

  pages={776-797},
  abstract={Gamification has been applied in software engineering to improve quality and results by increasing people's motivation and engagement. A systematic mapping has identified research gaps in the field, one of them being the difficulty of creating an integrated gamified environment comprising all the tools of an organization, since most existing gamified tools are custom developments or prototypes. In this paper, we propose a gamification software architecture that allows us to transform the work environment of a software organization into an integrated gamified environment, i.e., the organization can maintain its tools, and the rewards obtained by the users for their actions in different tools will mount up. We developed a gamification engine based on our proposal, and we carried out a case study in which we applied it in a real software development company. The case study shows that the gamification engine has allowed the company to create a gamified workplace by integrating custom-developed tools and off-the-shelf tools such as Redmine, TestLink, or JUnit, with the gamification engine. Two main advantages can be highlighted: (i) our solution allows the organization to maintain its current tools, and (ii) the rewards for actions in any tool accumulate in a centralized gamified environment.},

  pages={98694-98701},
  abstract={Understanding and simulating human behavior during the evacuation is essential in cognitive computing, which can be used to guide pedestrians to evacuate quickly and to avoid a potential hazard. In this paper, we propose a model to simulate the human behavior for evacuation from a classroom. Specifically, first, we give an improved evacuation model based on cellular automata, which consists of the static floor field and the dynamic floor field. Then, we present the detailed algorithms for calculating both the floor fields. The static floor field is calculated using an A-star algorithm, which can be used to solve the evacuation environments with and without obstacles. The dynamic floor field is calculated based on the impact of the number of pedestrians in each exit area on evacuation. Finally, the calculation method of pedestrian movement probability and the model evolution rules are given. The simulation experiments using our model have been conducted, and comparisons between our model and some state-of-the-art evacuation models are also conducted. The experimental results show that the model is effective and can reproduce the evacuation experiments conducted by students well. The model is expected to yield the optimal evacuation plan from the indoor environment.},

  pages={333-341},
  abstract={Gender in video games is a popular topic. However, the focus is usually on how gender is portrayed within games. In this paper, we examine the effects of players' gender on the perception of virtual character behavior and emotion based on the results of two user studies involving story-based games. The first study compared players' perception of virtual character behaviors. We analyzed perceived differences both by gender and by gaming experience. In this study, we found that female gamers were more appreciative of complex behaviors than male gamers. In the second study, we examined the influence of gender on player' ability to identify the emotion being displayed by a virtual character. We found that most emotions were identified comparably, with the exception of anger. Female players were significantly better at identifying angry characters compared to male players. We also investigated any perception differences between emotions expressed by male and female virtual characters, but we did not identify any statistically significant differences. Overall, the studies suggest that there are differences in how male and female players perceive virtual characters, and if game designers want players to perceive these characters in a certain way, they should consider the gender of targeted players.},

  volume={3},
  number={1},
  pages={87-103},
  abstract={Purpose – Drawing upon the motivational affordance theory, this paper aims to investigate how gamification design and human motivational needs are associated in extant literature. Design/methodology/approach – The authors conducted a literature analysis of 60 journal articles that studied motivational influences of gamification in information technology design. Content analysis was used to identify game design features and motivation variables studied in prior literature, and correspondence analysis was used to show the co-occurrence of game design features and basic motivational needs. Findings – The results showed that four types of game design features and eight basic motivational needs are studied in this pool of literature. Correspondence analysis indicates some interesting associations between game design features and basic human needs. Research limitations/implications - This research used a motivational affordance perspective to interpret the impact of game design features and suggested directions for future investigations. It is limited due to its sample size and considered as an exploratory study. Practical implications - This research provided suggestions for technology designers that game design features vary in their motivational influence, and therefore, game design features should be used accordingly to meet users' motivational needs. Originality/value – This research is one of initial studies which explored the association between game design features and basic motivational needs. The findings of this study provide the groundwork for guidelines and strategies to facilitate motivational design in information technology.},

  abstract={Integrating game elements into gaming-related applications has long been recognized as a powerful tool for enhancing user engagement and overall effectiveness. Despite the numerous studies examining the impact of gamification on engagement, the specific factors that drive this phenomenon remain unclear. To address this knowledge gap, the present study employs the gameful experience questionnaire (GAMEFULQUEST) perspective in the context of fitness apps, exploring the effects of seven key gamified experience factors on consumer engagement. The study surveyed a sample of 240 users of various fitness gamified apps, operationalizing engagement through cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions. The results revealed that users' experiences of challenge, immersion, and social interaction significantly enhanced engagement, while accomplishments, competition, and guidance did not have a significant impact. Using GAMEFULQUEST, the model effectively explains and predicts consumer engagement, offering valuable insights both in theory and in practical application. This article is a key contribution that leverages the GAMEFULQUEST approach to clearly explain the relationship between gamified experiences and user engagement with fitness apps, providing valuable insights for game designers and researchers alike.},

  abstract={This study aimed to explore the effects of gameplay dynamics on players’ visual attention. We examined gameplay dynamics related to the game system, player, and context, which have the potential to influence visual attention. We divided the game interface into four areas of interest, namely avatar, obstacles, game score, and text explaining the game. We investigated how data from four designated areas of interest varied for different eye-gaze measures, including the total duration of fixations, the time to first fixation, and the number of fixations. Data were collected from 32 participants through the Tobii Pro Fusion eye tracker and questionnaires. Overall, the total fixation duration was highest for obstacles, followed by avatar, game score, and text area. This was similar to the time to first fixation metric, as the participants predominantly directed their attention to game elements in the same order. Gamers and high-in-game performers developed covert attention that was skewed and transitional, expanding from the avatar to the obstacles. In contrast, non-gamers, low-in-game performers, and participants with low-in-game experience focused their visual attention mostly on the game score and text area.},

  pages={692-704},
  abstract={Logical connectives (e.g., or, if, and not) are central to everyday conversation, and the inferences they generate are made with little effort in pragmatically sound situations. In contrast, the neural substrates of logical inference-making have been studied exclusively in abstract tasks where pragmatic concerns are minimal. Here, we used fMRI in an innovative design that employed narratives to investigate the interaction between logical reasoning and pragmatic processing in natural discourse. Each narrative contained three premises followed by a statement. In Fully-deductive stories, the statement confirmed a conclusion that followed from two steps of disjunction–elimination (e.g., Xavier considers Thursday, Friday, or Saturday for inviting his girlfriend out; he removes Thursday before he rejects Saturday and declares “I will invite her out for Friday”). In Implicated-premise stories, an otherwise identical narrative included three premises that twice removed a single option from consideration (i.e., Xavier rejects Thursday for two different reasons). The conclusion therefore necessarily prompts an implication (i.e., Xavier must have removed Saturday from consideration as well). We report two main findings. First, conclusions of Implicated-premise stories are associated with more activity than conclusions of Fully-deductive stories in a bilateral frontoparietal system, suggesting that these regions play a role in inferring an implicated premise. Second, brain connectivity between these regions increases with pragmatic abilities when reading conclusions in Implicated-premise stories. These findings suggest that pragmatic processing interacts with logical inference-making when understanding arguments in narrative discourse.},

  year={2025},
  volume={17},

  pages={196-209},
  abstract={Improving the energy efficiency and reducing the CO$_{2}$ emissions are key strategic objectives for governments on an international level. Although children represent the future energy consumers and efforts have been made to enhance their understanding of energy consumption, there is a lack of initiatives focused on assessing children's awareness regarding energy usage at home and school. Serious games present a highly effective approach to educate and raise children's awareness about energy production and consumption; they are widely used to simulate real-world scenarios, inform or raise players' awareness, and stimulate their problem-solving abilities. Moreover, they assist players in visualising their actions and intuitively exploring different events. This article discusses the development of a serious game, the GreenMate game, which visually portrays the daily activities and experiences of a primary school student. It incorporates progressive levels to enhance comprehension and knowledge of the diverse factors influencing the growing energy crisis, as well as strategies for managing and mitigating them. According to our experimental findings, the GreenMate game can be used as a productive educational tool to effectively foster desired changes in children's behavior regarding energy consumption.},

  abstract={Human brain and behavior provide a rich venue that can inspire novel control and learning methods for robotics. In an attempt to exemplify such a development by inspiring how humans acquire knowledge and transfer skills among tasks, we introduce a novel multi-task reinforcement learning framework named Episodic Return Progress with Bidirectional Progressive Neural Networks (ERP-BPNN). The proposed ERP-BPNN model 1) learns in a human-like interleaved manner by 2) autonomous task switching based on a novel intrinsic motivation signal and, in contrast to existing methods, 3) allows bidirectional skill transfer among tasks. ERP-BPNN is a general architecture applicable to several multi-task learning settings; in this paper, we present the details of its neural architecture and show its ability to enable effective learning and skill transfer among morphologically different robots in a reaching task. The developed Bidirectional Progressive Neural Network (BPNN) architecture enables bidirectional skill transfer without requiring incremental training and seamlessly integrates with online task arbitration. The task arbitration mechanism developed is based on soft Episodic Return progress (ERP), a novel intrinsic motivation (IM) signal. To evaluate our method, we use quantifiable robotics metrics such as ‘expected distance to goal’ and ‘path straightness’ in addition to the usual reward-based measure of episodic return common in reinforcement learning. With simulation experiments, we show that ERP-BPNN achieves faster cumulative convergence and improves performance in all metrics considered among morphologically different robots compared to the baselines. Overall, our method provides a human-inspired and efficient multi-task reinforcement learning approach with interleaved learning, making it highly suitable for lifelong learning applications.},

  abstract={The rise of the metaverse—a convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and persistent virtual spaces—presents transformative potential for the healthcare sector. This study systematically explores how metaverse technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), and digital twins, contribute to achieving United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG3), which focuses on good health and well-being. By integrating these technologies, the metaverse offers innovative solutions for telemedicine, medical training, mental health support, public health education, and global medical research collaboration. This study maps the current research landscape, highlighting the capacity of metaverse technologies to address critical healthcare challenges and improve patient outcomes. We analyze the evolution of metaverse-related topics, tracking the shift from technological development to healthcare applications for SDG3. We map keyword trends to show how metaverse technologies are increasingly applied to improve healthcare and support SDG3. This study reviews the highly cited publications for each major topic identified by BERTopic modeling in the context of integrating digital twins and VR technologies in healthcare. Digital twins enhance healthcare processes by improving diagnosis and treatment, contributing to SDG3 targets. VR technologies in rehabilitation show promising results in improving physical and cognitive health, aligning with SDG3 targets. The role of VR in addiction recovery and mental health highlights its potential as an innovative therapeutic method. The integration of metaverse technologies, such as AR and VR, improves training, surgical precision, and pain management, advancing global health goals and supporting various SDGs. High acceptance rates among healthcare professionals and patients reflect the perceived benefits and alignment of these technologies with existing practices. However, successful adoption requires addressing ethical, legal, and privacy concerns, as well as ensuring equitable access and robust regulatory frameworks. This study underscores the metaverse’s potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery, training, and research, supporting the attainment of SDG3.},

  pages={40-50},
  abstract={How can human infants gradually socialize through interaction with their caregivers? This paper presents a learning mechanism that incrementally acquires social actions by finding and reproducing the contingency in interaction with a caregiver. A contingency measure based on transfer entropy is used to select the appropriate pairs of variables to be associated to acquire social actions from the set of all possible pairs. Joint attention behavior is tested to examine the development of social actions caused by responding to changes in caregiver behavior due to reproducing the found contingency. The results of computer simulations of human-robot interaction indicate that a robot acquires a series of actions related to joint attention such as gaze following and alternation in an order that almost matches the infant development of joint attention found in developmental psychology. The difference in the order between them is discussed based on the analysis of robot behavior, and then future issues are given.},

A HUMP model has been introduced to evaluate the effect of hedonic (perceived playfulness), utilitarian (perceived usefulness) e-mavenism, polychronicity, and perceived ease of use on the intention to use and thus actual use of social networking sites. The causal modeling technique is used to study the outline of associations amid the projected model constructs and to analytically evaluate the research propositions. All the conjectured factors possess a considerable unswerving sway on the intention to use, with e-mavenism and polychronicity, the robust indicators.},

  volume={15},

  pages={549-565},
  abstract={In day-to-day life, stress can arise due to various factors including work–life demands, external situations, and health issues. Stress becomes a concern when it affects a person's mental health, and sometimes it can even result in other chronic illnesses. Currently, stress-detection studies in the literature are often limited to laboratory studies or to specific situations. However, daily stressors are ongoing, and therefore, detection of stress in everyday life (outside the laboratory environments) is important to improve the wellbeing of individuals. Computer games are entertainment media that can be found in almost every household in the modern society. Statistics show that people spend hours playing computer games daily. The amount of data that gameplay generates and interactivity they provide via various human computer interfaces have a lot of potential in identifying behavior patterns of the players that could assist in the process of stress detection. As such, this survey attempts to identify the extent to which computer games can be used as a medium for stress detection. Toward this end, this survey reviews the existing stress-detection studies, both laboratory techniques as well as the techniques that can be used in a home-based environment. Finally, it summarizes the stress-detection techniques that can be used within games in order to make it an everyday technology that can be used to detect and monitor stress. In addition, it is expected that development of such a technology will be useful in providing objective data to the healthcare professionals for intervention and management. Such a technology is even more required in the current unprecedented situation the world has faced due to the COVID-19 pandemic as it can be developed as a technology to manage mental health issues people are facing due to home isolation.},

  pages={484-493},
  abstract={Until now, research on arrangement of verbal and non-verbal information in multimedia presentations has not considered multimodal behavior of animated agents. In this paper, we will present an experiment exploring the effects of different types of speech–gesture cooperation in agents’ behavior: redundancy (gestures duplicate pieces of information conveyed by speech), complementarity (distribution of information across speech and gestures) and a control condition in which gesture does not convey semantic information. Using a Latin-square design, these strategies were attributed to agents of different appearances to present different objects. Fifty-four male and 54 female users attended three short presentations performed by the agents, recalled the content of presentations and evaluated both the presentations and the agents. Although speech–gesture cooperation was not consciously perceived, it proved to influence users’ recall performance and subjective evaluations: redundancy increased verbal information recall, ratings of the quality of explanation, and expressiveness of agents. Redundancy also resulted in higher likeability scores for the agents and a more positive perception of their personality. Users’ gender had no influence on this set of results.},

  abstract={Digital games can make unique and powerful contributions to K-12 science education, but much of that potential remains unrealized. Research evaluating games for learning still relies primarily on pre- and post-test data, which limits possible insights into more complex interactions between game design features, gameplay, and formal assessment. Therefore, a critical step forward involves developing rich representations for analyzing gameplay data. This paper leverages data mining techniques to model learning and performance, using a metadata markup language that relates game actions to concepts relevant to specific game contexts. We discuss results from a classroom study and identify potential relationships between students' planning/prediction behaviors observed across game levels and improvement on formal assessments. The results have implications for scaffolding specific activities, that include physics learning during gameplay, solution planning and effect prediction. Overall, the approach underscores the value of our contextualized approach to gameplay markup to facilitate data mining and discovery.},

  title={Designing a Mobile Serious Game for Raising Awareness of Diabetic Children}, 
  year={2020},

  pages={222876-222889},
  abstract={Mobile serious games are very important tools for self-learning, training, and edutainment. They can be used to improve the children's learning skills to grasp new concepts rapidly in an enjoyable manner. Fun, motivation, and engagement are the most important features in designing attractive serious games. Therefore, designers should always find the best strategies and techniques to keep children playing the game with motivation and enthusiasm. The process is very long and requires different expertise from all the stakeholders. Arcade games are the most played games for fun and amusement in the last decades. Their approach is based on simplicity, easiness, repetitiveness, and soft challenges. The players of arcade games need only to improve their scores in every episode and avoid frustration and hard challenges as in other games. Hence, this arcade-based approach can be used in designing attractive serious games for young children and adolescents. We propose in this research a new serious game for diabetic children to teach them about the disease in a very easy manner. The game uses the arcade approach coupled with useful information about diabetes where the children discover them incrementally during the play. The longer time the child spends on the game, the most she/he can learn and enhance her/his knowledge on the disease. The game success came from its design and implementation with the presence of diabetes children, advisors, and nutritionists. We compare the game with the well-known DEX pet-based game for diabetes awareness on different aspects including user experience, usability, and learning outcomes. The study is conducted on twenty children from a diabetes camp who accepted voluntarily to participate in this research. We evaluate their educational aspects, using an improved version of the MEEGA+ model. We demonstrate the importance of the proposed game in enhancing the children knowledge on diabetes and adopt a new healthy lifestyle.},

  year={2015},
  volume={7},
  number={3},
  pages={207-219},
  abstract={This paper shows how game analytics can be used to dynamically adapt casual game environments in order to increase session-level retention. Our technique involves using game analytics to create an abstracted game analytic space to make the problem tractable. We then model player retention in this space and use these models to make guided changes to game analytics in order to bring about a targeted distribution of game states that will, in turn, influence player behavior. Experiments performed showed that the adaptive versions of two different casual games, Scrabblesque and Sidequest: The Game, were able to better fit a target distribution of game states while also significantly reducing the quitting rate compared to the nonadaptive version of the games. We showed that these gains were not coming at the cost of player experience by performing a psychometric evaluation in which we measured player intrinsic motivation and engagement with the game environments. In both cases, we showed that players playing the adaptive version of the games reported higher intrinsic motivation and engagement scores than players playing the nonadaptive version of the games.},

  abstract={Joyce Weisbecker was always interested in her father Joseph’s work. What child wouldn’t be? Joseph was the inventor of the Think-a-Dot and other games, a writer, and a magician who loved learning and teaching. But that’s not all. Joseph was also the engineer who led RCA into a new technological era with his 8-bit microprocessor architecture. Throughout the 1970s, he prototyped and developed a number of programmable video games, educational systems, and game consoles, all showcasing what a game changer the microprocessor was going to be to a nascent consumer electronics industry. These included the hobbyist’s build-it-yourself COSMAC Elf articles and the Studio II programmable video game console. Weisbecker followed along with her father’s inventions, spending time with him in his at-home workshop, and in the summer of 1976, before her freshman year in college, she sold her car race game Speedway to RCA for its Studio II, making her the first indie game developer.},

  pages={268-280},
  abstract={Visual analysis of human behavior has generated considerable interest in the field of computer vision because of its wide spectrum of potential applications. Human behavior can be segmented into atomic actions, each of which indicates a basic and complete movement. Learning and recognizing atomic human actions are essential to human behavior analysis. In this paper, we propose a framework for handling this task using variable-length Markov models (VLMMs). The framework is comprised of the following two modules: a posture labeling module and a VLMM atomic action learning and recognition module. First, a posture template selection algorithm, based on a modified shape context matching technique, is developed. The selected posture templates form a codebook that is used to convert input posture sequences into discrete symbol sequences for subsequent processing. Then, the VLMM technique is applied to learn the training symbol sequences of atomic actions. Finally, the constructed VLMMs are transformed into hidden Markov models (HMMs) for recognizing input atomic actions. This approach combines the advantages of the excellent learning function of a VLMM and the fault-tolerant recognition ability of an HMM. Experiments on realistic data demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system.},

  abstract={Existing telehealth systems do not perform as effectively as would be expected due to their asymmetric focus on sensing and monitoring with little support or assurance to affect or alter behaviors. We developed Action-based Behavior Model (ABM) that supports persuasive telehealth. However, ABM requires an ongoing assessment of user behavior response and compliance to cyber influence. Method: To measure compliance, we developed Situation-based Assess Tree (SAT) as a methodology and an algorithm for domain-specific behavior assessment under ABM. We followed a proof-of-concept validation approach based on a trace-driven simulation. Results: Preliminary results demonstrate that SAT is sentient to the full spectrum of compliance clearly discerning between compliant and noncompliant user responses. Results also demonstrate SAT's ability to learn different user personas through the assessment process.},

  abstract={Research in learning technologies is often focused on optimizing some aspects of human learning. However, the usefulness of practical learning environments is heavily influenced by their weakest aspects, and, unfortunately, there are many things that can go wrong in the learning process. In this article, we argue that in many circumstances, it is more useful to focus on avoiding stupidity rather than seeking optimality. To make this perspective specific and actionable, we propose a definition of stupidity, a taxonomy of undesirable behaviors of learning environments, and an overview of data-driven techniques for finding defects. The provided overview is directly applicable in the development of learning environments and also provides inspiration for novel research directions and novel applications of existing techniques.},

  title={The Game Effect: Comparison of Game and Nongame Learning Environments Using the Example of “Arctic Economy”}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={17},
  number={},
  pages={84-97},
  abstract={Virtual environments open up far-reaching possibilities with respect to knowledge impartation. Nevertheless, they have the potential to negatively influence learning behavior. As a possible positive determinant, especially in the digital context, the moment “game” can be listed. Accordingly, previous studies prove an overall positive influence of serious games on learning success and motivation. However, the current state of research only allows for careful and few conclusions in terms of a nuanced differentiation of this influence. Thus, this study differentiates on a deeper level with regard to different parameters of learning success and motivation. The aim of the study is to quantify and evaluate a possible influence of the factor “game” with regard to these parameters. Two versions of the modular software environment Arctic Economy, a game and a nongame version, served as the basis for evaluation. Both versions were compared in a field experiment, with randomized group formation (N = 97) and repeated measures. The data analysis showed the game group having a tendency to demonstrate better learning performance. In the differentiated analysis, a significant effect can be proven: subjects in the game group were able to remember facts more easily than subjects in the nongame group (group difference retention rate $\overline{x}=$ 17%). In addition, participants showed an average of 46% higher motivation and were significantly more capable of linking the application's content with reality. The identified “game effect” can therefore be classified as highly significant in the context of this study.},

  pages={42-47},
  abstract={The mental-health app Woebot launched in 2017, back when “chatbot” wasn't a familiar term and someone seeking a therapist could only imagine talking to a human being. Woebot was something exciting and new: a way for people to get on-demand mental-health support in the form of a responsive, empathic, AI-powered chatbot. Users found that the friendly robot avatar checked in on them every day, kept track of their progress, and was always available to talk something through. ¶ Today, the situation is vastly different. Demand for mental-health services has surged while the supply of clinicians has stagnated. There are thousands of apps that offer automated support for mental health and wellness. And ChatGPT has helped millions of people experiment with conversational AI. ¶ But even as the world has become fascinated with generative AI, people have also seen its downsides. As a company that relies on conversation, Woebot Health had to decide whether generative AI could make Woebot a better tool, or whether the technology was too dangerous to incorporate into our product. ¶ Woebot is designed to have structured conversations through which it delivers evidence-based tools inspired by cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a technique that aims to change behaviors and feelings. Throughout its history, Woebot Health has used technology from a subdiscipline of AI known as natural-language processing (NLP). The company has used AI artfully and by design—Woebot uses NLP only in the service of better understanding a user's written texts so it can respond in the most appropriate way, thus encouraging users to engage more deeply with the process.},

  year={2018},
  volume={48},
  number={4},
  pages={380-391},
  abstract={Home energy savings via eco-feedback is often considered a serious, tedious, or even distracting task due to the need for frequent human intervention. In addition, most existing eco-feedback systems focus on providing energy usage information and ignore the users' contexts. This may render the systems incapable of capturing the users' changes when proenvironmental behaviors have been encouraged. To address this, our study leverages Internet of Things (IoT) enabled technologies to realize an adaptive, context-aware, and playful cyber-physical system (CPS) for everyday energy savings with the hope of facilitating collaboration between a person and a smart energy-saving (ES) system to the greatest extent possible. To leverage the benefits inherent in a CPS, bidirectionally interactive information visualization integrated with pet-raising gamification was incorporated into the adaptive CPS. This synchronized the information from the user's physical environment with its counterpart in the pet's virtual environment. In order to provide flexible services, all IoT devices were agentized to form reconfigurable agents. In our experimental evaluation, this bidirectional mapping empowered users to flexibly control remote appliances anywhere and anytime in a more natural way, which enabled users to embed interactions with the ES CPS into their daily routine. Furthermore, improvements to system adaptability (33% in precision; 21% in recall) along with the reconfigurable ES services (additionally saving energy about 16.21%) show the potential of the CPS to enhance the users' experience and prolong the users' engagement in everyday energy savings.},

  year={2023},
  volume={11},

  pages={89077-89092},
  abstract={Collective emergent behaviours are commonly seen in nature such as in flocks of birds and schools of fish. These behaviours are the results of years of evolution and have been studied in artificial agent systems in a wide range of application areas such as robotics, serious games, and crowd simulations. Automatic recognition of such collective behaviours is imperative in such application areas in order to measure and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the artificial agent systems, especially when it involves machine learning approaches where human labelling is not feasible. While it is easy for the human eye to recognise collective behaviours, this is an extremely challenging task for a machine to automatically recognise them as such emergent behaviours cannot be captured by a simple mathematical equation. This paper investigates how emergent behaviours can be automatically recognised through capturing the behavioural aspects of the collective nature of the agents’ performance. We identify seven metrics such as grouping, order, and flock density that can capture diverse and distinct emergent characteristics of agent behaviours. Five machine learning models that use a combination of these metrics as features of a range of representative behaviours were trained to investigate the potential of automatic recognition of collective emergent behaviours. The evaluation results show that training the machine learning models with the proposed approach enables automatic recognition of a range of diverse emergent collective behaviours. Further, we conducted leave-one-behaviour-out experiments on the representative behaviours and the metrics used. The results confirmed that each behaviour and metric have a unique impact on accurate recognition of emergent behaviours in collective agent systems.},

  abstract={Non-Playable Characters (NPCs) are a subtype of virtual agents that populate video games by endorsing social roles in the narrative. To infer NPCs’ roles, players evaluate NPCs’ appearance and behaviors, usually by ascribing human traits to NPCs, such as intelligence, likability and morality. In particular, hostile NPCs in video games are essential to build the games’ inherent challenges. The three experiments reported here investigated the extent to which the perception of hostility in a military shooter game (including both threat of appearance and aggressiveness in behaviors) is influenced by the appearance and the behaviors of NPCs thanks to perceived intelligence, likability and morality-related questionnaires. Our results first show that hostility is efficiently conveyed through NPCs’ behaviors, but not significantly by their appearance. Second, our study allows identifying the main predictors of hostility perception, namely unfriendliness, knowledge and harmfulness.},

  year={2015},

  pages={1419-1431},
  abstract={Social robots working among pedestrians can attract crowds of people around them and consequently become bothersome entities causing congestion in narrow spaces. This in turn can affect the comfort of pedestrians who wish to pass through. To address this problem, our idea is to endow the robot with three capabilities: anticipating pedestrian crowding around the robot, understanding pedestrians' walking comfort, and planning to avoid congestions in advance. Combining several elementary pedestrian behavior models, the robot is able to simulate hypothetical situations where it navigates between pedestrians and anticipate the degree to which this would affect the pedestrians' walking comfort. During planning, the robot determines the best next navigation step based on the results of simulations. We tested the developed system in a real shopping mall and confirmed that it successfully reduces the robot's influence on pedestrian walking comfort due to congestions.},

  year={2023},
  volume={15},
  number={4},
  pages={2014-2030},
  abstract={Open-ended learning is a core research field of developmental robotics and AI aiming to build learning machines and robots that can autonomously acquire knowledge and skills incrementally as infants. The first contribution of this work is to highlight the challenges posed by the previously proposed benchmark “REAL competition” fostering the development of truly open-ended learning robots. The benchmark involves a simulated camera-arm robot that: 1) in a first “intrinsic phase” acquires sensorimotor competence by autonomously interacting with objects and 2) in a second “extrinsic phase” is tested with tasks, unknown in the intrinsic phase, to measure the quality of previously acquired knowledge. The benchmark requires the solution of multiple challenges usually tackled in isolation, in particular exploration, sparse-rewards, object learning, generalization, task/goal self-generation, and autonomous skill learning. As a second contribution, the work presents a “REAL-X” architecture. Different systems implementing the architecture can solve different versions of the benchmark progressively releasing initial simplifications. The REAL-X systems are based on a planning approach that dynamically increases abstraction and on intrinsic motivations to foster exploration. Some systems achieves a good performance level in very demanding conditions. Overall, the REAL benchmark is shown to represent a valuable tool for studying open-ended learning in its hardest form.},

  year={2024},
  volume={54},
  number={6},
  pages={3705-3715},
  abstract={To enhance the collaborative intelligence of a machine, it is important for the machine to understand what behavior a human may adopt to interact with the machine when performing a task in shared control. In this study, an online behavior learning method is proposed for continuous-time linear human-in-the-loop shared control systems by using the system state data only. A two-player nonzero-sum linear quadratic dynamic game paradigm is used for modeling the control interaction between a human operator and an automation that actively compensates for human control action. In this game model, the cost function representing the human behavior is assumed to have an unknown weighting matrix. Here, we want to learn the human behavior or retrieve the weighting matrix by using the system state data only. Accordingly, a new adaptive inverse differential game (IDG) method, which integrates concurrent learning (CL) and linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization, is proposed. First, a CL-based adaptive law and an interactive controller of the automation are developed to estimate the feedback gain matrix of the human online, and second, an LMI optimization problem is solved to determine the weighting matrix of the human cost function. Finally, simulation results on a cooperative shared control driver assistance system are provided to elucidate the feasibility of the developed method.},

  year={2024},
  volume={16},
  number={3},
  pages={509-517},
  abstract={Many real-life tasks can be abstracted as sparse reward visual scenes, which can make it difficult for an agent to accomplish tasks accepting only images and sparse reward. To address this problem, we split it into two parts: visual representation and sparse reward, and propose our novel framework, called image augmentation-based momentum memory intrinsic reward, which combines self-supervised representation learning with intrinsic motivation. For visual representation, we acquire a representation driven by a combination of image-augmented forward dynamics and reward. To handle sparse reward, we design a new type of intrinsic reward called momentum memory intrinsic reward, which uses the difference between the outputs from the current model (online network) and the historical model (target network) to indicate the agent's state familiarity. We evaluate our method on a visual navigation task with sparse reward in VizDoom and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of sample efficiency. Our method is at least two times faster than existing methods and reaches a 100% success rate.},

  year={2009},

  pages={423-463},
  abstract={We present an individual-based predator-prey model with, for the first time, each agent behavior being modeled by a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM), allowing the evolution of the agent behavior through the epochs of the simulation. The FCM enables the agent to evaluate its environment (e.g., distance to predator or prey, distance to potential breeding partner, distance to food, energy level) and its internal states (e.g., fear, hunger, curiosity), and to choose several possible actions such as evasion, eating, or breeding. The FCM of each individual is unique and is the result of the evolutionary process. The notion of species is also implemented in such a way that species emerge from the evolving population of agents. To our knowledge, our system is the only one that allows the modeling of links between behavior patterns and speciation. The simulation produces a lot of data, including number of individuals, level of energy by individual, choice of action, age of the individuals, and average FCM associated with each species. This study investigates patterns of macroevolutionary processes, such as the emergence of species in a simulated ecosystem, and proposes a general framework for the study of specific ecological problems such as invasive species and species diversity patterns. We present promising results showing coherent behaviors of the whole simulation with the emergence of strong correlation patterns also observed in existing ecosystems.},

  abstract={For casual users, how do goals and incentives interact with visualization usage patterns? Professional race car drivers are almost exclusively concerned about a car's performance, whereas average car owners might be swayed by fuel efficiency, aesthetics, and even color. Similarly, factors other than performance might motivate casual information visualization (InfoVis) users. Outside of work contexts, visualizations serve as cognitive aids, art, propaganda, and even procrastination aids. Out of curiosity, we asked two women with no computer science training to look at the digg visualizations by Stamen design. To our surprise, comments changed from "sooo cute" and "I like [the] animation" during the first minute to "annoying" and "cute but not practical" less than five minutes later. Motion rapidly went from being appealing and motivating to being distracting and discouraging. Perhaps simply getting eyes on the screen is insufficient. But what makes a visualization successful in informal contexts, and if we do not know, how do we find out?},

They show that forcibly removing players from the game environment causes distress, potentially removing some of the benefits that games provide and producing a desire for more game time. They also show that, with an understanding of player psychology, playtime can be manipulated without significantly changing the user experience or negating the positive effects of video games.},

  year={2020},
  volume={12},
  number={4},
  pages={809-823},
  abstract={Video games are a widespread leisure activity and essential for a substantial field of research. In several kinds of research, video games show positive effects on cognition. Video games’ ability to change the brain in a way that improves cognition is already evident in the research world. The underlying brain dynamics assessed by coherence (Coh) and partial-directed coherence (PDC) can shed light on the effect of video game playing. Here, resting-state brain dynamics have been analyzed before and after four weeks of video game playing. Fifteen participants took part in this article, which ran for one consecutive month. Participants played a gem-swapping game with a brain–computer interface (BCI) paradigm for five days per week for approximately 90 min for four continuous weeks. Significant ( $p< 0.05$ ) changes in information flow and connectivity measures for Coh and PDC were found in the fronto-central, fronto-parietal, and centro-parietal networks due to extended interaction with BCI. The results suggest that BCI is a potential facilitator of such resting-state network changes and may help to develop new strategies for improving cognition, but we also cannot deny the possible effects of such an effort on the disruption of a player’s sense of engagement and increased mental fatigue.},

  title={Simulation and analysis of bid evaluation behaviors for multiattribute reverse auction}, 
  year={2015},
  volume={9},
  number={1},
  pages={165-176},
  abstract={Reverse auctions with multiattributes are widely used for centralized procurements of large enterprises and government departments. The bid evaluation mechanism is a key factor for a fair auction and resource allocation. The current bid evaluation process is usually done by two groups, a business expert group and a technical expert group, separately. Taking bounded rationality as a precondition, we analyze the existence of antagonistic feelings between the two groups. The antagonistic feelings may grow as time goes by. To verify the discovered points, a multiagent-based approach is used to simulate the bid evaluation behaviors. The prototype system of a current bid evaluation mechanism is described by a multiagent model. In the model, the behaviors of both auctioneer and bidders are described by the attributes of each agent and decision rules. Their interactions are described by the collaboration and information exchange between different agents. The procedure of multiagent simulation is specifically presented. Then, the multiagent simulation system is developed and repeatedly runs on the platform of MATLAB GUI while adjusting relevant parameters. The results demonstrate that the behaviors of raising and repressing bid scores are increasingly severe with the passage of time. The result is that differences between the two groups increase with a decrease in the objectiveness of experts. The accumulation of antagonistic feelings can be obviously observed. The current mechanism is unfair to the bidders, as it may make the best bid lose the auction. To solve this problem, two modified bid evaluation mechanisms are suggested. The simulation comparison results show that the new bid evaluation mechanisms can efficiently weaken the antagonistic feelings of the two groups. Finally, three constructive suggestions are put forward to the organizer of tendering and bidding.},

  abstract={Video games are one of the richest and most popular forms of human-computer interaction and, hence, their role is critical for our understanding of human behaviour and affect at a large scale. As artificial intelligence (AI) tools are gradually adopted by the game industry a series of ethical concerns arise. Such concerns, however, have so far not been extensively discussed in a video game context. Motivated by the lack of a comprehensive review on the ethics of AI as applied to games, we survey the current state of the art in this area and discuss ethical considerations of these systems from the holistic perspective of the affective loop. Through the components of this loop, we study the ethical challenges that AI faces in video game development. Elicitation highlights the ethical boundaries of artificially induced emotions; sensing showcases the trade-off between privacy and safe gaming spaces; and detection, as utilised during in-game adaptation, poses challenges to transparency and ownership. This paper calls for an open dialogue and action for the games of today and the virtual spaces of the future. By setting an appropriate framework we aim to protect users and to guide developers towards safer and better experiences for their customers.},

  abstract={Internet usage has grown dramatically since the early years of its inception. The rich field of data provided by internet users in interaction with digital media content can provide insight into web-based navigation behavior and underlying psychological dimensions. Human–computer interaction in the web is an underutilized source of data for understanding human online behavior. While researchers and usability testing services do use these sources to analyze human behavior and user experience, access to the diverse range of other potentially useful data available during web-based interaction for research is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel tool in the form of a web browser extension, referred to as Latent, which can be used to simultaneously capture information from different sources while users interact with digital content. The data acquisition capabilities of Latent makes it suitable for various research purposes, ranging from studies of usability to decision-making and personality. A particular advantage of Latent is that the method and control of data acquisition is completely transparent to the user. We present the architecture of the web browser extension, describe the data that can be acquired, and report on the residual impact of the tool on the user’s computer processing resources.},

  pages={148-157},
  abstract={We propose that learning agents (LAs) be incorporated into simulation environments in order to model the adaptive behavior of humans. These LAs adapt to specific circumstances and events during the simulation run. They would select tasks to be accomplished among a given set of tasks as the simulation progresses, or synthesize tasks for themselves based on their observations of the environment and on information they may receive from other agents. We investigate an approach in which agents are assigned goals when the simulation starts and then pursue these goals autonomously and adaptively. During the simulation, agents progressively improve their ability to accomplish their goals effectively and safely. Agents learn from their own observations and from the experience of other agents with whom they exchange information. Each LA starts with a given representation of the simulation environment from which it progressively constructs its own internal representation and uses it to make decisions. The paper describes how learning neural networks can support this approach and shows that goal based learning may be used effectively used in this context. An example simulation is presented in which agents represent manned vehicles; they are assigned the goal of traversing a dangerous metropolitan grid safely and rapidly using goal based reinforcement learning with neural networks and compared to three other algorithms.},

  abstract={In the last decade, many commercial video games have used planners instead of classical behavior trees or finite state machines to define agent behaviors. Planners allow looking ahead in time and can prevent some problems of purely reactive systems. Furthermore, some of them allow coordination of multiple agents. However, implementing a planner for highly dynamic environments such as video games is a difficult task. This paper aims to provide an overview of different elements of planners and the problems that developers might have when dealing with them. We identify the major areas of plan creation and execution, trying to guide developers through the process of implementing a planner and discuss possible solutions for problems that may arise in the following areas: environment, planning domain, goals, agents, actions, plan creation, and plan execution processes. Giving insights into multiple commercial games, we show different possibilities of solving such problems and discuss which solutions are better suited under specific circumstances, and why some academic approaches find a limited application in the context of commercial titles.},

  year={2022},
  volume={6},

  pages={159-166},
  abstract={In a video game review, the main focus is the narratives, characters, graphics, and mechanics in the gameplay. Some recent research mentions the user interface only when it comes into light as a creative platform for simple interactive narratives from a technical point of view; this narrative is mainly a software tool that requires traditionally modernized inputs from the user. The user needs to interact with the navigational controls or menus in order to start a basic game play. A complex game interface as stimulus is generally considered as having a feeling of immersion that allows for visual tracking of user behavioural patterns and use it to predict the next strategy of the user using robust computational models. A number of users have limited sensory perception in a gameplay and hence rely on complex game stimulus and an adaptive model is paramount when considering behavioural expectations that place the user in a digital environment with more expressive perceptions. We developed a custom based eye tracking and 3D object detection algorithm which was utilised by recruiting users to interact with visual 3D objects and trace their eye movement behaviour to generated data. We then applied the use of recurrent neural network (RNN) for direct tracing of user behavioural activities in a sequential manner to predict their behaviour for interface adaptation. Result indicates that redundant user attributes are flexible and flawless for identifying predicted response of the user in a controlled environment. This would lead to prototypical representation of user behavioural analytics as an embedded platform in the confined digital environment. One of the limitations of the project is its inability to basically specify the 3D gaze point at the inner boundaries of the visual field. Data visualisation is strictly based on combined object flow detection. The originality of the work is its ability to redefine fixation point to a rendered cascaded 3D gaze point and space-defined saccade which is indicated by the distance between one gaze points to the other. The 3D gaze point would be well suited for fixation generalisation on 3D as well as on 2D digital oriented environment.},

  abstract={Loot boxes are garnering increased attention in both the industry and media. One focal point of the discussion is whether loot boxes should be considered a form of gambling. While parallels can be drawn between loot boxes and random reward schedules, researchers have argued that the “glorification” aspect of loot boxes that have heightened player awareness (e.g., opening a box, a pack of cards, or spinning a wheel) of randomness is a relatively new trend in games. However, there is currently a dearth of empirical research on loot boxes. We make two contributions in this paper: 1) Infinite Loot Box, an open-source Unity platform for experimenting with loot boxes created from scratch; and 2) a 2 × 2 experiment (high/low visual effects × high/low audial effects; N = 1235). We find that high audial effects significantly increase the number of loot boxes opened. Neither audial nor visual effects were found to significantly impact other variables. These contributions push forward our understanding of loot boxes and their contextual factors.},

  abstract={In some evolutionary robotics experiments, evolved robots are transferred from simulation to reality, while sensor/motor data flows back from reality to improve the next transferral. We envision a generalization of this approach: a simulation-to-reality pipeline. In this pipeline, increasingly embodied agents flow up through a sequence of increasingly physically realistic simulators, while data flows back down to improve the next transferral between neighboring simulators; physical reality is the last link in this chain. As a first proof of concept, we introduce a two-link chain: A fast yet low-fidelity (lo-fi) simulator hosts minimally embodied agents, which gradually evolve controllers and morphologies to colonize a slow yet high-fidelity (hi-fi) simulator. The agents are thus physically scaffolded. We show here that, given the same computational budget, these physically scaffolded robots reach higher performance in the hi-fi simulator than do robots that only evolve in the hi-fi simulator, but only for a sufficiently difficult task. These results suggest that a simulation-to-reality pipeline may strike a good balance between accelerating evolution in simulation while anchoring the results in reality, free the investigator from having to prespecify the robot's morphology, and pave the way to scalable, automated, robot-generating systems.},

  abstract={E-Learning Ecosystems (ELE) offer excellent opportunities to manage teaching activities by incorporating state-of-the-art technologies, practices, and professional support, as well as learning and assessment resources that can be adaptive. Therefore, it can help people with disabilities or conditions such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) to develop skills. However, some technological factors prevent this population’s implementation of support scenarios and hinder the proper learning process. This paper systematically reviews relevant studies on E-Learning Ecosystems for people with ASD, identifying the influence of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) on forming ELE and the technological barriers that affect their development and appropriate use on people with ASD. This work conducted a systematic review using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology, including a search of five scientific literature databases from 2017 to 2022. The main aspects identified were 1) a shortage in design guides for the implementation of e-learning ecosystems adapted for people with ASD, 2) technological barriers that prevent the development of ELE, and 3) recommendations that help to mitigate the limitations of this field. In addition, the authors identified that the skills with the most significant focus of interest were social, communicative, and cognitive. The most implemented technologies include virtual and augmented reality or mobile applications. Most studies involved children with ASD between 8 and 15 years, followed by works with children between 5 to 8 years. Very few researches linked adults with ASD. Very few studies mention the ASD level of the participants, but most highlight the positive results of implementing ICT in training processes.},

  abstract={We introduce an algorithm for segmenting brain magnetic resonance (MR) images into anatomical compartments such as the major tissue classes and neuro-anatomical structures of the gray matter. The algorithm is guided by prior information represented within a tree structure. The tree mirrors the hierarchy of anatomical structures and the subtrees correspond to limited segmentation problems. The solution to each problem is estimated via a conventional classifier. Our algorithm can be adapted to a wide range of segmentation problems by modifying the tree structure or replacing the classifier. We evaluate the performance of our new segmentation approach by revisiting a previously published statistical group comparison between first-episode schizophrenia patients, first-episode affective psychosis patients, and comparison subjects. The original study is based on 50 MR volumes in which an expert identified the brain tissue classes as well as the superior temporal gyrus, amygdala, and hippocampus. We generate analogous segmentations using our new method and repeat the statistical group comparison. The results of our analysis are similar to the original findings, except for one structure (the left superior temporal gyrus) in which a trend-level statistical significance (p = 0.07) was observed instead of statistical significance.},

  abstract={This article proposes a procedural content generator which evolves Minecraft buildings according to an open-ended and intrinsic definition of novelty. To realize this goal, we evaluate individuals’ novelty in the latent space using a 3-D autoencoder (AE), and alternate between phases of exploration and transformation. During exploration the system evolves multiple populations of CPPNs through CPPN-NEAT and constrained novelty search in the latent space (defined by the current AE). We apply a set of repair and constraint functions to ensure candidates adhere to basic structural rules during evolution. During transformation, we reshape the boundaries of the latent space to identify new interesting areas of the solution space by retraining the AE with novel content. In this study, we evaluate five different approaches for training the AE during transformation and its impact on populations’ quality and diversity during evolution. Our results show that by retraining the AE we can achieve better open-ended complexity compared to a static model, which is further improved when retraining using larger datasets of individuals with diverse complexities.},

  abstract={State of the art research shows that gamified learning can be used to engage students and help them perform better. However, most studies use a one-size-fits-all approach to gamification, where individual differences and needs are ignored. In a previous study, we identified four types of students attending a gamified college course, characterized by different levels of performance, engagement and behavior. In this paper, we present a new experiment where we study what data best characterizes each of our student types and explore if this data can be used to predict a student's type early in the course. To this end, we used machine-learning algorithms to classify student data from one term and predict the students' type on another term. We identified two sets of relevant features that best describe our types, one containing only performance measurements and another also containing data regarding the students' gaming preferences. Results show that performance alone can be used to predict student type with 79 percent accuracy by midterm. However, its accuracy improves when paired with gaming data at earlier stages of the course. In this paper, we clearly describe our findings and discuss the lessons learned from this experiment.},

  pages={1361-1374},
  abstract={Using brain signals rather than limbs to drive a vehicle may not only help persons with disabilities to acquire driving ability, but also provide a new alternative interface for healthy people to control a vehicle. However, the longitudinal driving performance of brain-controlled vehicles (BCVs) at a relatively high speed is not good enough. In this paper, to improve the performance of the longitudinal brain-control driving, we propose a new predictive control method based on the models of human behaviors and vehicle dynamics. The proposed method is designed to maintain rear-end safety of BCVs and driver ride comfort while ensuring the maximum control authority of brain-control drivers. Driver-and-hardware-in-the-loop experiments are conducted with different subjects under three kinds of scenarios to validate the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method is effective in maintaining rear-end safety and driver ride comfort while preserving driver intention.},

  abstract={Energy demand in a smart grid is directly related to energy consumption, as defined by user needs and comfort experience. This article presents a multi-agent architecture for smart control of space heating and cooling processes, in an attempt to enable flexible ways of monitoring and adjusting energy supply and demand. In this proposed system, control agents are implemented in order to perform temperature set-point delegation for heating and cooling systems in a building, offering a means to observe and learn from both the environment and the occupant. Operation of the proposed algorithms is compared with traditional algorithms utilized for room heating, using a simulated model of a residential building and real data about user behaviour. The results show (i) the performance of machine learning for the occupancy forecasting problem and for the problem of calculating the time to heat or cool a room; and (ii) the performance of the control algorithms, with respect to energy consumption and occupant comfort. The proposed control agents make it possible to significantly improve an occupant comfort with a relatively small increase in energy consumption, compared with simple control strategies that always maintain predefined temperatures. The findings enable the smart grid to anticipate the energy needs of the building.},

  year={2011},

  abstract={Multiagent-based simulation (MABS) is a very active interdisciplinary area bridging multiagent research and social science. The key technology to conduct truly useful MABS is agent modeling for reproducing realistic behaviors. In order to make agent models realistic, it seems natural to learn from human behavior in the real world. The challenge presented in this paper is to obtain an individual behavior model by using participatory modeling in the traffic domain. We show a methodology that can elicit prior knowledge for explaining human driving behavior in specific environments, and then construct a driving behavior model based on the set of prior knowledge. In the real world, human drivers often perform unintentional actions, and occasionally, they have no logical reason for their actions. In these cases, we cannot rely on prior knowledge to explain them. We are forced to construct a behavior model with an insufficient amount of knowledge to reproduce the driving behavior. To construct such individual driving behavior model, we take the approach of using knowledge from others to complement the lack of knowledge from the target. To clarify that the behavior model including prior knowledge from others offers individuality in driving behavior, we experimentally confirm that the driving behaviors reproduced by the hybrid model correlate reasonably well with human behavior.},

  abstract={Traffic vehicle behavior prediction is a necessary prerequisite for intelligent vehicle behavior decision and trajectory planning. The behaviors of vehicles are deeply interactive. In order to reasonably predict the future behavior of traffic vehicles, based on the Game theory, this paper designs the behavior prediction framework of traffic vehicles, and establishes the GMM(Gaussian Mixture Model)-HMM(Hidden Markov Model) behavior recognition model. Then, the revenue function is designed to model the driver's intent by calculating the vehicle's front running space, collision risk and comfort loss under each scenario. And the NGSIM dataset is used to train the parameters in the GMM-HMM model and those in the revenue function. Finally, two groups of experiments are designed to compare this method with the traditional method. The experimental results show that the proposed method can predict the future behavior of traffic vehicles earlier, and can also well reflect the interaction process of vehicle behavior, and has better robustness.},

  abstract={A brain stroke could result in the loss of neuromotor and cognitive functions. Poststroke rehabilitation therapy is used to enable patients to regain some of their lost functionalities. However, traditional rehabilitation faces problems related to the availability of physiotherapists and specific equipment. In home therapy is more convenient for poststroke patients, but their motivation and adherence to their medical regime must be addressed properly. This article presents a game-based in-home rehabilitation system based on two different design approaches. The first design approach (A1) consists of selecting games or ludic activities and adapting them to meet the treatment object ives, the second design approach (A2) consists of selecting and virtualizing the physiotherapy exercises being used at the hospital. The results of the usability study showed that the system is usable. The game difficulty levels were similar for both approaches. The perception of fun was greater for A1 than for A2. Additionally, both approaches were considered motivating for the subjects. The usability study showed that the rehabilitation games reported in this research are usable and motivating. In future research, these games will be integrated into a neuromotor rehabilitation program for poststroke patients.},

  abstract={To reflect an evacuation process using a conventional agent-based approach to model human movement under chemical gas exposure, a scalable and hybrid agent-based simulation (ABS) model incorporates an interactive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) gas flow model. To embrace the hybrid ABS model, CFD model, and models for countermeasure in various domains, a scalable runtime infrastructure (RTI)-based simulation environment is also proposed. This environment provides a simulator-level interface to integrate a continuous and discrete-event simulator into the RTI by resolving data/event interaction and time synchronization among heterogeneous simulation models. The authors successfully interoperated the hybrid ABS model, interactive CFD model, control center model, and gas sensor model to evaluate the countermeasures in the proposed environment. As a case study, they applied a 3D-based virtual training engine as a standalone modeling and simulation element to show the scalability of the proposed environment.},

This study examines an earlier system dynamics simulation of MBO in an R&D setting performed by Poziomek, Rice, and Anderson, and suggests an alternative approach to MBO which stresses the nonevaluative contributions an MBO system can make to the researcher. The results of applying this alternative approach to MBO to a simulated R&D setting results in a substantial increase in productivity and the maintenance of social harmony within the group.},

  abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic has suspended physical classes and influenced students from underprivileged groups more seriously due to their poor living conditions and digital disadvantages. To understand the impact of the constrained learning, we conducted a study on game-based learning to examine the effectiveness of computer-aided and autonomous learning of traditional Chinese by underprivileged students. From December 2020 to May 2021, we collected 3245 quiz results from 26 underprivileged students over six months. The quizzes systematically covered the fundamentals of learning traditional Chinese in six aspects, i.e., literacy, orthography, phonology, morphology, speaking, and writing. We analyzed the results to understand the learning efficacy of students. Remarkably, students can significantly improve their skills in literacy and phonology through unsupervised game-based learning. Furthermore, by parsing the writing tasks, we observe substantial improvements among 7 out of 13 common types of writing mistakes. Our study provides a critical lens to understand the design opportunities of game-based learning without direct supervision.},

  abstract={With the increasing size of data, massive amounts of data are being generated continuously.

A cognitive computing model based on context-aware data flow is constructed. Classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm is used in the data computing layer of the cognitive model. In addition, the clustering effectiveness index based on frequent patterns optimizes the K-means clustering method. The performance of the algorithm is analyzed through simulation experiments. The results show that the CART algorithm requires fewer training data sets while guaranteeing classification accuracy. Also, the algorithm has obvious advantages under large-scale data. In the application of actual data set, on Over, Over+Noise, and Bridge, only the clustering validity index based on frequent pattern (FPCVI) index proposed finds the correct number of clusters. The application of DPCK-K-means clustering algorithm can ensure the accuracy and stability of behavior classification, which is greatly significant for operators to analyze user behavior and develop personalized services.},

Both versions of the game are compared in terms of knowledge acquisition and motivation enhancement through a robust empirical study involving 289 students and instruments, such as prepost tests and a questionnaire. The obtained results suggest that both formats of the game are useful for acquiring knowledge and promoting aspects, such as fun, motivation, and engagement. The results also suggest, strikingly, that there is no difference in terms of learning effectiveness between the two versions of the game.},

  abstract={Behavioral simulation plays an important role in many scenarios, such as emergency evacuation and public safety. The importance of public security in modern life can be seen in the epidemic outbreak in 2020. In particular, the epidemic can affect people's psychology and emotions and change people's behavior. Therefore, how to effectively improve people's positive emotions in a panic has become an urgent problem. In social relations, most behaviors are produced by peer interaction. To simulate the interactions among peers more realistically, this paper studies the diversity and efficiency of evacuation behaviors from the trust of peers, the strength of social relations and empathy. First, a general framework of peer relationships is constructed based on asymmetric intimacy, including the relationship between intimacy relationship modeling. Then, the problem of the dynamic formation of peer groups is studied by employing the calculation method of asymmetric intimacy. The effect of positive emotion transmission mechanism on peer interaction behaviors is explored through asymmetric intimacy. Finally, the companion behaviors of the peers in several scenarios are simulated. The proposed method is compared with different emotion contagion models and the behavioral simulation models. Experimental results show that the positive emotions contagion of the peer behavior simulation method can concrete the macro group behavior and effectively simulate the peer group in an evacuation. The simulation effects are diverse and efficient.},

  abstract={We address the problem of ego-vehicle navigation in dense simulated traffic environments populated by road agents with varying driver behaviors. Navigation in such environments is challenging due to unpredictability in agents&#x2019; actions caused by their heterogeneous behaviors. We present a new simulation technique consisting of enriching existing traffic simulators with behavior-rich trajectories corresponding to varying levels of aggressiveness. We generate these trajectories with the help of a driver behavior modeling algorithm. We then use the enriched simulator to train a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policy that consists of a set of high-level vehicle control commands and use this policy at test time to perform local navigation in dense traffic. Our policy implicitly models the interactions between traffic agents and computes safe trajectories for the ego-vehicle accounting for aggressive driver maneuvers such as overtaking, over-speeding, weaving, and sudden lane changes. Our enhanced behavior-rich simulator can be used for generating datasets that consist of trajectories corresponding to diverse driver behaviors and traffic densities, and our behavior-based navigation scheme can be combined with state-of-the-art navigation algorithms.},

The aim of the videogame is to motivate young people to go to classical theater plays and to familiarize students with the plot and the characters before they go to the theater. This goal is achieved by making avatars interesting to players, by incorporating different theater techniques to generate characters' personalities and by including the elements that can be used as audiovisual content such as music, scenery, and costume design. In this paper, we also present the results of an initial evaluation of the game with master's students from the E-learning group. In order to improve the game, we have studied its effects in terms of improvement of knowledge, learning outcomes, and student motivation.},

  abstract={SpiNNaker (Spiking Neural Network Architecture) is a specialized computing engine, intended for real-time simulation of neural systems. It consists of a mesh of 240x240 nodes, each containing 18 ARM9 processors: over a million cores, communicating via a bespoke network. Ultimately, the machine will support the simulation of up to a billion neurons in real time, allowing simulation experiments to be taken to hitherto unattainable scales. The architecture achieves this by ignoring three of the axioms of computer design: the communication fabric is non-deterministic; there is no global core synchronisation, and the system state-held in distributed memory-is not coherent. Time models itself: there is no notion of computed simulation time-wallclock time is simulation time. Whilst these design decisions are orthogonal to conventional wisdom, they bring the engine behavior closer to its intended simulation target-neural systems. We describe how SpiNNaker simulates large neural ensembles; we provide performance figures and outline some failure mechanisms. SpiNNaker simulation time scales 1:1 with wallclock time at least up to nine million synaptic connections on a 768 core subsystem (~1400th of the full system) to accurately produce logically predicted results.},

  pages={708-721},
  abstract={We have recently developed an automated approach to reduce students' rationalization of programming plagiarism and collusion by informing them about the matter and reporting uncommon similarities to them for each of their submissions. Although the approach has benefits, it does not greatly engage students, which might limit those benefits. To discover its full potential, we employ gamification based on self-determination theory and nine heuristics suggested by Roy and Zaman (2017). Students earn more game points by submitting unique programs early, reading the generated reports, and collecting badges. Those with the highest game points are rewarded at the end of the course. According to our evaluation, involving 240 computing undergraduates in three quasi-experiments over three academic semesters, students with gamification become slightly more aware of programming plagiarism and collusion, complete assessments earlier, and read generated reports more frequently. Students engage with the gamification and perceive its impact on usability.},

  abstract={Manual control cybernetics aims to understand and describe how humans control vehicles and devices using mathematical models of human control dynamics. This “cybernetic approach” enables objective and quantitative comparisons of human behavior, and allows a systematic optimization of human control interfaces and training associated with manual control. Current cybernetics theory is primarily based on technology and analysis methods formalized in the 1960s and has shown to be limited in its capability to capture the full breadth of human cognition and control. This paper reviews the current state-of-the-art in our knowledge of human manual control, points out the main fundamental limitations in cybernetics, and proposes a possible roadmap to advance the theory and its applications. Central in this roadmap will be a shift from the current linear time-invariant modeling approach that is only truly valid for human behavior under tightly controlled and stationary conditions, to methods that facilitate the analysis of adaptive, and possibly time-varying, human behavior in realistic control tasks. Examples of key current developments in the field of cybernetics-human use of preview, predictable discrete maneuvering, skill acquisition and training, time-varying human modeling, and neuromuscular system modeling-that contribute to this shift are presented in this paper. The new foundations for cybernetics that will emerge from these efforts will impact all domains that involve humans in manual and semiautomatic control.},

  year={1975},

  pages={189-201},
  abstract={There is much concern over the implications of increasing population growth and resource consumption. It may be that traditional academic disciplines have not yet reoriented their goals to deal with this question in a completely satisfactory manner. With the proliferation of computers and computer technology, it is inevitable that some researchers would attempt simulations of long-term human behavior with respect to environment and resources. The great weakness of these ``simulation models'' is that they can never be validated and, therefore, cannot inspire unqualified confidence. Their great strength is that they are summaries of expert opinion and could serve as a focus for multidisciplinary research. The identification of parameters for such models is the main theme of this paper. It is shown that parameter identification, for the proper choice of a ``goodness of fit'' criterion, can be a rapid, always convergent process. This same criterion usually allows identification to occur independently for each state equation. Independence could be especially conducive to multidisciplinary human behavior model building. The technique is illustrated with an identification for a nonlinear, discrete-time simulation model (17th order) of the use of land and energy in California. This model has 80 parameters, which were identified with 150 data points and a few minutes of computer time. Only the hypothetical dynamic relations for agricultural variables need be rejected in this preliminary effort.},

  year={2014},
  volume={22},

  pages={419-427},
  abstract={The present study covers a new experimental system, designed to improve the balance and postural control of adults with cerebral palsy. This system is based on a serious game for balance rehabilitation therapy, designed using the prototype development paradigm and features for rehabilitation with serious games: feedback, adaptability, motivational elements, and monitoring. In addition, the employed interaction technology is based on computer vision because motor rehabilitation consists of body movements that can be recorded, and because vision capture technology is noninvasive and can be used for clients who have difficulties in holding physical devices. Previous research has indicated that serious games help to motivate clients in therapy sessions; however, there remains a paucity of clinical evidence involving functionality. We rigorously evaluated the effects of physiotherapy treatment on balance and gait function of adult subjects with cerebral palsy undergoing our experimental system. A 24-week physiotherapy intervention program was conducted with nine adults from a cerebral palsy center who exercised weekly in 20-min sessions. Findings demonstrated a significant increase in balance and gait function scores resulting in indicators of greater independence for our participating adults. Scores improved from 16 to 21 points in a scale of 28, according to the Tinetti Scale for risk of falls, moving from high fall risk to moderate fall risk. Our promising results indicate that our experimental system is feasible for balance rehabilitation therapy.},

  year={2020},
  volume={39},
  number={1},
  pages={140-151},
  abstract={Accurate scatter correction is essential for qualitative and quantitative PET imaging. Until now, scatter correction based on Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) has been recognized as the most accurate method of scatter correction for PET. However, the major disadvantage of MCS is its long computational time, which makes it unfeasible for clinical usage. Meanwhile, single scatter simulation (SSS) is the most widely used method for scatter correction. Nevertheless, SSS has the disadvantage of limited robustness for dynamic measurements and for the measurement of large objects. In this work, a newly developed implementation of MCS using graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration is employed, allowing full MCS-based scatter correction in clinical 3D brain PET imaging. Starting from the generation of annihilation photons to their detection in the simulated PET scanner, all relevant physical interactions and transport phenomena of the photons were simulated on GPUs. This resulted in an expected distribution of scattered events, which was subsequently used to correct the measured emission data. The accuracy of the approach was validated with simulations using GATE (Geant4 Application for Tomography Emission), and its performance was compared to SSS. The comparison of the computation time between a GPU and a single-threaded CPU showed an acceleration factor of 776 for a voxelized brain phantom study. The speedup of the MCS implemented on the GPU represents a major step toward the application of the more accurate MCS-based scatter correction for PET imaging in clinical routine.},

  abstract={This paper applies two experimental economics methods (i.e., agent-based modeling and laboratory experiment) to a market test suite that is based on a fictional European wholesale electricity market. Quantitative results of generators' strategic behavior in this market context are separated between generators played by human subjects (i.e., master students) in a laboratory experiment and generators represented by computational agents in an agent-based model. The behavior is measured through offers that students or agents make when participating in the electricity trading auction and the market outcomes under both methods are discussed in order to illustrate the difference between the behavior of human and computational agents. The paper also identifies the improvements that would need to be made to the market test suite to allow for a more conclusive comparison in future experiments.},

  year={2022},
  volume={7},

  pages={770-777},
  abstract={We introduce a novel simulation-based approach to identify hazards that result from unexpected worker behavior in human-robot collaboration. Simulation-based safety testing must take into account the fact that human behavior is variable and that human error can occur. When only the expected worker behavior is simulated, critical hazards can remain undiscovered. On the other hand, simulating all possible worker behaviors is computationally infeasible. This raises the problem of how to find interesting (i.e., potentially hazardous) worker behaviors given a limited number of simulation runs. We frame this as a search problem in the space of possible worker behaviors. Because this search space can get quite complex, we introduce the following measures: (1) Search space restriction based on workflow-constraints, (2) prioritization of behaviors based on how far they deviate from the nominal behavior, and (3) the use of a risk metric to guide the search towards high-risk behaviors which are more likely to expose hazards. We demonstrate the approach in a collaborative workflow scenario that involves a human worker, a robot arm, and a mobile robot.},

  abstract={Students’ perception of excessive difficulty in STEM degrees lowers their motivation and, therefore, affects their performance. According to prior research, the use of gamification techniques promote engagement, motivation, and fun when learning. Badges, which are a distinction that is given as a reward to students, are a well-known gamification tool. This contribution hypothesizes that the use of badges, both physical and virtual, improves student performance and reduces dropout rates. To verify that hypothesis, a case study involving 99 students enrolled in a Databases course of computer engineering degrees was conducted. The results show that the usage of badges improves student performance and reduces dropout rates. However, negligible differences were found between the use of different kind of badges.},

To address this limitation, we propose Playful, a software platform that applies reactive programming to the specification of robotic behavior.},

  abstract={We study how pairs of children interact socially and express their emotions while playing games in different communicative settings. In particular, we study how such interactions can vary for environments that differ regarding the level of mediation and the associated feelings of social presence. Overall, the study compared three conditions (one face-to-face gameplay condition, and two video-mediated gameplay conditions; one allowing for mutual gaze, the other not) and focused on the social presence and non-verbal behavior of children in three conditions. The results show that the presence of mutual eye-gaze enriches the feelings of social presence, fun and game experience; conversely, the absence of mutual eye-gaze dramatically effects the quality of interaction in the video-mediated environment. The results of this study stress the importance of mutual gaze, and we therefore argue that it should become an integral component of future VMC systems, particularly in those designed for playful settings and children.},

  volume={48},
  number={4},
  pages={1242-1252},
  abstract={This paper investigates how humans use a previewed target trajectory for control in tracking tasks with various controlled element dynamics. The human's hypothesized “near” and “far” control mechanisms are first analyzed offline in simulations with a quasi-linear model. Second, human control behavior is quantified by fitting the same model to measurements from a human-in-the-loop experiment, where subjects tracked identical target trajectories with a pursuit and a preview display, each with gain, single-, and double-integrator controlled element dynamics. Results show that target-tracking performance improves with preview, primarily due to the far-viewpoint response, which allows humans to cancel their own and the controlled element's lags, without additional control activity. The near-viewpoint response yields better target tracking at higher frequencies, but requires substantially more control activity. The control-theoretic approach adopted in this paper provides unique quantitative insights into human use of preview, which can help to explain human behavior observed in other preview control tasks, like driving.},

  abstract={Many mixed-signal circuits are nonlinear time-varying systems whose noise estimation cannot be obtained from the conventional frequency domain noise simulation (FNS). Although the transient noise simulation (TNS) supported by a commercial simulator takes into account nonlinear time-varying characteristics of the circuit, its simulation time is unacceptably long to obtain meaningful noise estimation results. Since the single-slope analog-to-digital converter with correlated double sampling (CDS/SS-ADC) in a CMOS image sensor (CIS) is composed of several operation phases in which the circuit topologies are different from each other, the noise cannot be estimated by the conventional FNS. This paper presents a noise estimation method for the CDS/SS-ADC that uses the FNS results while the transient noise behavior is taken into account. The proposed method provides noise estimation results closer to that of the TNS than the conventional FNS, whereas the simulation time is about the same as that of the FNS.},
