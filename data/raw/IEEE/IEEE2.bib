  abstract={The device-level real-time simulation of power converters is constrained by the contradiction between the required short simulation time step to describe the transient behaviors and the large computational amount caused by the nonlinearities of switches’ models. In this paper, a novel low-latency device-level power converter modeling approach is proposed for field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based real-time simulation. A piecewise linear insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT)/diode transient model is proposed based on the inductive switching behaviors. The switching transient is modeled into four phases, which are identified by the boundaries between three operating regions of IGBT and between two operating modes of a diode. Moreover, each phase is approximated by a linear continuous behavior in order to reduce the real-time computational amounts. Accompanied by the effective boundary identification, the device-level IGBT/diode model can be efficiently integrated into the real-time simulation with low computational latency. A dc–dc–ac topology model is implemented on the FPGA-based real-time platform, as a case study to verify the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed approach. With the help of circuit partitioning techniques, the device-level converter model can be simulated with a 50-ns time step on FPGA. Moreover, the accuracy of FPGA-based simulation results is validated by the error evaluation with respect to the results from offline simulation tools.},

  abstract={We present a model of changing the intensity of interaction based on the individual behavior to study the iterated prisoner's dilemma game in social networks. In this model, each individual has an assessed score of reputation which is obtained by considering the evaluation level of interactive partners for its present behavior. We focus on the effect of evaluation level on the changing intensity of interaction between individuals. For an individual with good behavior, the higher the evaluation level of its partners for its good behavior, the better its reputation, and the higher the probability of surrounding partners interaction with it. On the contrary, for an individual with bad behavior, the lower the evaluation level of its partners for its bad behavior, the worse its reputation, and the less the probability of surrounding neighbors interaction with it. Simulation results show that this effective mechanism can drastically facilitate the emergence and maintenance of cooperation in the population under a treacherous chip. Interestingly, for a small or moderate treacherous chip, the cooperation level monotonously ascends as the evaluation level increases; however, for a higher treacherous chip, existing an optimal evaluation level, which can result in the best promotion of cooperation. Furthermore, we find better agreement between simulation results and theoretical predictions obtained from an extended pair-approximation method, although there are some tiny deviations. We also show some typical snapshots of the system and investigate the reason for appearance and persistence of cooperation. The results further show the importance of evaluation level of individual behavior in coevolutionary relationships.},

  title={Experimental Evaluation of a Serious Game for Teaching Software Process Modeling}, 
  year={2015},
  volume={58},

  pages={289-296},
  abstract={Software process modeling (SPM) is an important area of software engineering because it provides a basis for managing, automating, and supporting software process improvement (SPI). Teaching SPM is a challenging task, mainly because it lays great emphasis on theory and offers few practical exercises. Furthermore, as yet few teaching approaches have aimed at teaching SPM by introducing innovative features, such as games. The use of games has mainly been focused on other areas of software engineering, for example software project management. In an attempt to fill this gap, this paper describes a formal experiment carried out to assess the learning effectiveness of a serious game (DesigMPS), designed to support the teaching of SPM, and to compare game-based learning with a project-based learning method. In the DesigMPS game, the student models a software process from an SPI perspective, based on the Brazilian SPI model (MPS.BR). The results indicate that playing the game can have a positive learning effect and results in a greater degree of learning effectiveness than does the project-based learning instructional method.},

  year={2007},

  pages={1974-1982},
  abstract={Interactions among neural signals in different frequency bands have become a focus of strong interest in neuroscience. Bispectral analysis, a type of higher order spectral analysis, provides us with the ability to investigate such nonlinear interactions. Based on the fact that the bispectrum of a linear Gaussian process is zero, a surrogate data method was proposed to test the null hypothesis that the original data were generated by a linear Gaussian process. The method was first tested on two simulation examples. It was then applied to local field potential recordings from a monkey performing a visuomotor task. The analysis reveals nonzero bispectra for beta and gamma band activities in the premotor cortex. The rigorous statistical framework proves essential in establishing these results.},

  number={1},
  pages={19-26},
  abstract={Contribution: This paper describes a highly flexible design for a master's-level server administration course that uses updated technologies, addresses the most important course design challenges and extracts useful feedback from student work. The main contribution of this design is eliminating the self-regulation challenge students encounter in similar highly flexible computer-related courses. This is attributed to the introduction of orientation lectures and a competitive element; these may have helped students to achieve their goals on time. Background: The Web server administration course on the master's of the Web engineering program was intended to inculcate a series of competences, such as common administration techniques, procedures to increase security, efficient website deployment, and an introduction to clusters and infrastructure deployment automation. The course generally failed to transmit these competencies effectively; complaints were made about the difficulty of the course and the low applicability of its contents. Intended Outcomes: The design facilitates students finding assessment activities that better suit their profiles or previous experience, and enables them to customize their assessment, thus encouraging them and giving future value to their work. Application Design: The course design maximizes assessment flexibility by providing students with many optional activities from which to choose. It also promotes a healthy competitive spirit to improve student's motivation and results. Findings: Complaints about the difficulty or lack of applicability were no longer made. The course is highly valued by the students, achieving a very high pass rate and average score.},

  abstract={Simulation has deeply infiltrated into the development and validation of planetary rover technologies concerning mobility and autonomy, by providing large amounts of data in a variety of conditions and environments, as well as high-fidelity prototypes. Prevalent approaches for rover simulation focus either on physical behaviors or visual scenarios. In this article, we present a simulator named MarsSim developed upon Robotic Operating System/Gazebo platform that supports both physical and visual realistic simulations. The interaction between the wheel and the rough deformable terrain is modeled with improved contact solutions, and the model is integrated into a refined physical simulation architecture as an independent terramechanics plugin. Using multiscale planetary data and representation models, Martian scenarios are constructed, considering characteristics in terms of the surface, rock, and atmosphere. Compared with experiments, the terramechanics plugin shows great modeling accuracy in fitting interactive force/torque and slip-sinkage phenomenon. The simulation of traverses with a six-wheeled planetary rover on Martian landscape is demonstrated with near-photoreal images, coupled with physical-realistic locomotive data under different terrains.},

  abstract={The wall-charge behaviors of the conventional and two types of single-sustain waveforms during address and sustain periods are investigated based on a simulated result and a Vt close-curve analysis. The single-sustain waveform means that the sustain pulse having both positive and negative voltage levels is applied only to the single-side electrode, i.e., the scan (Y) electrode in this paper, where the common (X) electrode remains grounded. In the single-sustain waveform, the address discharge characteristics were observed to be improved by applying a higher voltage level without causing a misfiring discharge during an address period. An asymmetric IR emission was observed for both positive and negative sustain pulses during a sustain period, which was caused by the simultaneous discharge, including the plate gap discharge between the scan (Y) and the address (A) electrodes only when applying the negative sustain pulse to the scan (Y) electrode.},

  pages={336-346},
  abstract={Digital games often center on a series of challenges designed to vary in difficulty over the course of the game. Designers, however, lack ways to ensure challenges are suitably tailored to the abilities of each game player, often resulting in player boredom or frustration. Challenge tailoring refers to the general problem of matching designer-intended challenges to player abilities. We present an approach to predict temporal player performance and select appropriate content to solve the challenge tailoring problem. Our temporal collaborative filtering approach-tensor factorization-captures similarities among players and the challenges they face to predict player performance on unseen, future challenges. Tensor factorization accounts for varying player abilities over time and is a generic approach capable of modeling many kinds of players. We use constraint solving to optimize content selection to match player skills to a designer-specified level of performance and present a model-performance curves-for designers to specify desired, temporally changing player behavior. We evaluate our approach in a role-playing game through two empirical studies of humans and one study using simulated agents. Our studies show tensor factorization scales in multiple game-relevant data dimensions, can be used for modestly effective game adaptation, and can predict divergent player learning trends.},

The Fe-Al system has shown different characteristics such as layer coverage function and mixing length, compared with other ferromagnetic/nonferromagnetic metallic bilayer systems. The different intermixing behavior could be successfully explained in terms of cohesive energy and local acceleration effect. In addition, it can be clearly seen that intermixing was rather insensitive to changes in the adatom kinetic energy but dependent on the substrate temperature.},

Techniques for FD-TLM modeling of a Josephson Atto-Webber switch (JAWS), a two-junction superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), and modified variable threshold logic (MVTL) logic gates are discussed and simulation results are presented. Interconnection lengths are intentionally short so that the full-wave FD-TLM simulation results can be validated with results of conventional quasistatic-based circuit simulations. Good agreement between the simulation techniques validates the FD-TLM JJ logic circuit modeling approach. In the FD-TLM method the electromagnetic behavior of the circuit is modeled from the material properties and dimensions of the circuit, avoiding separate extractions of parasitic capacitance and inductance as needed in conventional circuit simulations.},

  pages={7302-7309},
  abstract={Autonomous racing poses a significant challenge for control, requiring planning minimum-time trajectories under uncertain dynamics and controlling vehicles at their handling limits. Current methods requiring hand-designed physical models or reward functions specific to each car or track. In contrast, imitation learning uses only expert demonstrations to learn a control policy. Imitated policies must model complex environment dynamics and human decision-making. Sequence modeling is highly effective in capturing intricate patterns of motion sequences but struggles to adapt to new environments or distribution shifts that are common in real-world robotics tasks. In contrast, Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) can mitigate this effect, but struggles with sample inefficiency and handling complex motion patterns. Thus, we propose BeTAIL: Behavior Transformer Adversarial Imitation Learning, which combines a Behavior Transformer (BeT) policy from human demonstrations with online AIL. BeTAIL adds an AIL residual policy to the BeT policy to model the sequential decision-making process of human experts and correct for out-of-distribution states or shifts in environment dynamics. We test BeTAIL on three challenges with expert-level demonstrations of real human gameplay in the high-fidelity racing game Gran Turismo Sport. Our proposed BeTAIL reduces environment interactions and improves racing performance and stability, even when the BeT is pretrained on different tracks than downstream learning.},

  title={Modeling Collective Behavior for Fish School With Deep Q-Networks}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={36630-36641},
  abstract={Modeling collective behavior is a way to better understand the mechanisms that govern collective animal behaviors. Traditional rule-based modeling methods rely heavily on human prior knowledge and may not provide a proper explanation of the phenomenon of collective behaviors. This paper proposes a Deep Q-Networks (DQN)-based modeling method for fish school. Firstly, an individual’s state (continuous value) is expressed by the angle between its direction and the average direction of its perceived neighbors. An individual’s action is represented with discretized turning angle. Then, the reward function is constructed with the change in the number of neighbors. And finally, the neural network structure is constructed to represent the Q-value function and is trained by the DQN algorithm. The proposed approach is tested in two scenarios: single-learner and multi-learner. Results show that in both scenarios the proposed method can gradually converge and finally obtain a model that can produce collective behavior. On this basis, this paper also deeply analyzes the learned model from the perspectives of average order parameter and collective behavior patterns. It verifies that the behavior pattern generated by the learned model is a highly ordered collective behavior. In addition, we make a comparison between our proposed approach and the Q-Learning algorithm. The results show that our approach not only has a stronger ability to express policy and is better at handling continuous states but also has a more stable learning performance in training.},

  abstract={I descnbe the selection of hard particles for case building in caddis fly larvae. The larvae prefer large and flat particles which are more profitable in terms of time and silk thread spent for building. When larva discover particles of various profitability in a random sequence, one may expect the sequence of larva's choices to be also random. However, the larvae tend to repeat acceptances and rejections of particles . This repetitive response sequence results in a partial choice of unprofitable particles. I developed a model of selection based on simple rules that real larvae use. The model qualitatively reproduces the preference for more profitable particles, as well as the repetition of responses and the partial choice. In the model, a random sequence of discovered particles is viewed upon as an external noise. The non-linear control mechanism transforms the noise into the repetitive behavioural sequence. Thus, the behaviour of model is the result of self-organisation in noise-driven system. I discuss how the seif-organising order may interfere with adaptive behaviour.},

  abstract={As the field of embodied cognitive science begins to mature, it is imperative to develop methods for identifying and quantifying the constraints and opportunities an agent's body places on its possible behaviours. In this paper we present results from a set of experiments conducted on 10 different legged agents, in which we evolve neural controllers for locomotion. The genetic algorithm and neural network architecture were kept constant across the agent set, but the agents had different sizes, masses and body plans. It was found that increased mass has a negative effect on the evolution of locomotion, but that this does not hold for all of the agents tested. Also, the number of legs has an effect on evolved behaviours, with hexapedal agents being the easiest for which to evolve locomotion, and wormlike agents being the most difficult. Moreover, it was found that repeating the experiments with a larger neural network increased the evolutionary potential of some of the agents, but not for all of them. The results suggest that by employing this methodology we can test hypotheses about the behavioural effect of specific morphological features, which has to date eluded precise quantitative analysis},

  abstract={In game design, creators strive to guide players toward specific strategies through the game’s mechanics. This assumes a level of predictability in player behavior, though in reality, players often deviate from expected rational strategies. We provide an ensemble mechanism to influence behavior in arbitrary normal-form games, even when players are not rational. Our algorithm adjusts the game’s reward structure to encourage gameplay that aligns with the designer’s intentions. At the algorithm’s core is a deep reinforcement learning technique that learns to model players’ real-world behavior. This mechanism is versatile and applicable beyond game design; it can be employed in various fields where one can frame problems as classification tasks. Incorporating actual gameplay data into the training process allows our algorithm to acquire a practical understanding of player decisions. The efficacy of our mechanism is evaluated by testing the mechanism’s performance against a panel of classifiers, which includes a support vector machine, random forest, and multi-layer perceptron.},

Physiological experiments demonstrated that decerebrate cats can adapt to periodic perturbation applied by the treadmill, and change their gait pattern with respect to the environmental changes. Based on this fact, we regard the adaptation as the process that adjusts memorized motion patterns to he more appropriate for the changed environments. Following this idea, we describe the adaptive behavior of decerebrate cat locomotion using a central pattern generator (CPG) model. We also take into account of the coupling of oscillators and limbs dynamics, and propose an adaptive control approach for the limb movements.},

Our result shows that the individual behavior builds up the distribution of species abundance resembling that of real ecosystem under the various conditions. This means that the amount of available resources affects not only the number of organisms, but also the adaptive behavior of the population in a local ecosystem. The observed adaptation in the present simulation study therefore indicates that there are more sustainable strategies than one under a given condition. The modelling technique presented here can also be applied to more detailed ecosystem simulations.},

  abstract={Reduced-order dynamic macromodels are an effective way to capture device behavior for rapid circuit and system simulation. In this paper, we report the successful implementation of a methodology for automatically generating reduced-order nonlinear dynamic macromodels from three-dimensional (3-D) physical simulations for the conservative-energy-domain behavior of electrostatically actuated microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices. These models are created with a syntax that is directly usable in circuit- and system-level simulators for complete MEMS system design. This method has been applied to several examples of electrostatically actuated microstructures: a suspended clamped beam, with and without residual stress, using both symmetric and asymmetric positions of the actuation electrode, and an elastically supported plate with an eccentric electrode and unequal springs, producing tilting when actuated. When compared to 3-D simulations, this method proves to be accurate for non-stress-stiffened motions, displacements for which the gradient of the strain energy due to bending is much larger than the corresponding gradient of the strain energy due to stretching of the neutral surface. In typical MEMS structures, this corresponds to displacements less than the element thickness, At larger displacements, the method must be modified to account for stress stiffening, which is the subject of part two of this paper.},

  abstract={A typical wireless sensor network (WSN) is often deployed in harsh or hostile environment to work in an unattended mode. It is prone to various attacks during routing process as the open wireless medium. Traditional encryption and authentication-based secure mechanisms cannot avoid the attacks from internal compromised nodes, and they also need much resource for complex computing. To conquer these problems, trust-based secure mechanism is usually used in WSNs. However, how to get the behavior evidences for trust assessment is rarely addressed to date. In this paper, we present a game theory-based dynamic behavior monitoring scheme for evidences collection in WSNs. A tradeoff between network security and energy conservation can be achieved. Based on this behavior monitoring scheme, a trust assessment mechanism is proposed, which is further integrated into cluster-based routing protocol. Simulation results show that our trust evaluation scheme can gain a higher network lifetime than full-time behavior monitoring-based trust evaluation scheme, while the performance of network security is not degraded.},

  abstract={In order to incorporate the uncertainty and impreciseness present in real-world event-driven asynchronous systems, fuzzy discrete event systems (DESs) (FDESs) have been proposed as an extension to crisp DESs. In this paper, first, we propose an extension to the supervisory control theory of FDES by redefining fuzzy controllable and uncontrollable events. The proposed supervisor is capable of enabling feasible uncontrollable and controllable events with different possibilities. Then, the extended supervisory control framework of FDES is employed to model and control several navigational tasks of a mobile robot using the behavior-based approach. The robot has limited sensory capabilities, and the navigations have been performed in several unmodeled environments. The reactive and deliberative behaviors of the mobile robotic system are weighted through fuzzy uncontrollable and controllable events, respectively. By employing the proposed supervisory controller, a command-fusion-type behavior coordination is achieved. The observability of fuzzy events is incorporated to represent the sensory imprecision. As a systematic analysis of the system, a fuzzy-state-based controllability measure is introduced. The approach is implemented in both simulation and real time. A performance evaluation is performed to quantitatively estimate the validity of the proposed approach over its counterparts.},

  abstract={Integrated circuit design has evolved to the stage where large, complex, analog and digital functionalities are implemented on a single chip or as an integrated chip set. Besides the mixed signal nature of the designs, the analog sections also include continuous-time and discrete-time components. Thus, for analysis of these integrated modules, all encompassing simulation capabilities are required that address, not only transient analysis of mixed analog-digital circuits, but frequency domain analysis as well. In this paper, we present mechanisms for multilevel and mixed-domain simulation of analog systems tied in with mixed analog-digital simulation. We then describe the implementation in the form of an open-ended and expandable simulation framework, iMACSIM. A simulation backplane is used to provide a general event-processing and scheduling framework that ties together the various algorithms necessary for simulation of various classes of circuits in different analysis regimes.},

  abstract={In this paper, a low-dimensional hidden nonlinear system is constructed by replacing two linear resistors of a simple integrating circuit with two active memristors. The system was analyzed in detail by using the Lyapunov exponent, 0-1 Test, Poincaré map, phase diagram, power spectral density diagram, time-domain waveform, and chaotic characteristic diagram. The results show that the system can oscillate by itself under zero initial conditions, and there are various transient transition behaviors, such as from chaos to limit cycle, chaos to quasi-periodic, quasi-periodic to another quasi-periodic transition, quasi-periodic to periodic transition. Besides, these transient processes themselves include 2, 3, 4, and 5 different states respectively, showing multiple transient transitions behavior, which are not reported in the related literature. It is also found that the initial states of these transition states have rich symmetrical attractors and the stable state is multistability. In addition, the global entropy analysis method is adopted to test the universal existence of transient behaviors, which demonstrates that the system has rich nonlinear characteristics. Finally, the memristive circuit verifies the system's physical feasibility and enriches the application of memristors in circuit theory.},

  abstract={The provision of reliable connectivity is envisioned as a key enabler for future autonomous driving. Anticipatory communication techniques have been proposed for proactively considering the properties of the highly dynamic radio channel within the communication systems themselves. Since real world experiments are highly time-consuming and lack a controllable environment, performance evaluations and parameter studies for novel anticipatory vehicular communication systems are typically carried out based on network simulations. However, due to the required simplifications and the wide range of unknown parameters (e.g., Mobile Network Operator (MNO)-specific configurations of the network infrastructure), the achieved results often differ significantly from the behavior in real world evaluations. In this paper, we present Data-driven Network Simulation (DDNS) as a novel data-driven approach for analyzing and optimizing anticipatory vehicular communication systems. Different machine learning models are combined for achieving a close to reality representation of the analyzed system's behavior. In a proof of concept evaluation focusing on opportunistic vehicular data transfer, the proposed method is validated against field measurements and system-level network simulation. In contrast to the latter, DDNS does not only provide massively faster result generation, it also achieves a significantly better representation of the real world behavior due to implicit consideration of cross-layer dependencies by the machine learning approach.},

We explore the user behaviors in sophisticated action space by reinforcement learning for catching unknown environment information. With Dueling Deep-Q Network, both the prediction accuracy of users' behaviors and the server load balance are well-considered, while increasing the computational efficiency and decreasing the resource costing. We propose a dynamic simulation environment of edge computing to demonstrate that user behavior is the critical factor for impacting system utilization. As the action space increasing, Dueling DQN performs better than state-of-art DQN and other improved strategies, and also load balance in multiple different server scenario.},

  year={2021},

  number={2},
  pages={160-169},
  abstract={Background: Exertion games are video games that require exercise. They are widely presented as health interventions, to encourage sedentary populations to take exercise at levels recommended by health professionals. Objectives: We consider whether games encourage acute exercise at levels sufficient to engender exercise-related health benefits, and in what conditions that occurs. Methods: In this article, we performed a scoping review of empirical research that examines whether exertion game play engenders exercise, searching Google Scholar, Scopus, and PubMed. Results: From 3171 search records, we found 243 studies of acute short-term exercise in games. While some observed moderate levels of exertion, players of many games fail to meet recommended levels. Few games encouraged vigorous levels seen in sports. Variation in results for games across different studies suggests that exertion motivation is highly dependent on nongame contextual factors. There is evidence games make exercise more enjoyable or reduce perceived exertion, but many studies suffer the methodological problem of comparison with boring control conditions. Conclusions: Exergames have only been found comparable to exercise such as walking, jogging, and dancing under very specific circumstances. To improve evidence for games as exercise interventions, we must improve study designs and focus on understanding better the circumstances likely to bring about genuine exergame exercise.},

  title={A Dynamic Sensitivity Model for Unidirectional Pedestrian Flow With Overtaking Behaviour and Its Application on Social Distancing’s Impact During COVID-19}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={23},
  number={8},
  pages={10404-10417},
  abstract={As a common phenomenon, overtaking behaviour is frequently observed on pedestrian flow, which not only reshapes pedestrian flow but also generates adverse impacts on pedestrian safety to some extent. Prior research focused on unidirectional pedestrian modelling, especially with overtaking behaviour, is limited. Moreover, pedestrian behaviour in the context of COVID-19 is rarely investigated. Inspired by the social force model, this paper proposes a dynamic sensitivity model for unidirectional pedestrian flow, which is able to describe the overtaking behaviour and analyse the potential impact of COVID-19 on pedestrian behaviour. In the proposed model, dynamic sensitivity and attention field of pedestrians are introduced to embody the effects of individual characteristics and surrounding environments on pedestrian behaviours. To calibrate the model and evaluate the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on pedestrian dynamics, real-life data collected by video recordings in Nanjing, China is used in this study. The simulation results indicate that the dynamic sensitivity model is able to reflect the variance of the adaptive velocity and route choice of overtaking pedestrians on unidirectional pedestrian flow. Our research findings show that the social distance during COVID-19 is higher than the value under normal conditions, and the majority of pedestrians tend to follow the suggested social distancing rules during COVID-19. Moreover, the overtaking pedestrians violate the suggested social distancing rules more frequently than the rest pedestrians.},

  abstract={Driver models play a vital role in developing and verifying autonomous vehicles (AVs). Previously, they were mainly applied in traffic flow simulation to model driver behavior. With the development of AVs, driver models attract much attention again due to their potential contributions to AV safety assessment. The simulation-based testing method is an effective measure to accelerate AV testing due to its safe and efficient characteristics. Nonetheless, realistic driver models are prerequisites for valid simulation results. Additionally, an AV is assumed to be at least as safe as a careful and competent driver, which is modeled by driver models as well. Therefore, driver models are essential for AV safety assessment from the current perspective. However, no comparison or discussion of driver models is available regarding their utility to AVs in the last five years despite their necessities in the release of AVs. This motivates us to present a comprehensive survey of driver models in the paper and compare their applicability. Requirements for driver models as applied to AV safety assessment are discussed. A summary of driver models for simulation-based testing and AV benchmarks is provided. Evaluation metrics are defined to compare their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, potential gaps in existing driver models are identified, which provide direction for future work. This study gives related researchers especially regulators an overview and helps them to define appropriate driver models for AV safety assessment.},

  year={2010},
  volume={46},
  number={6},
  pages={1825-1828},
  abstract={The effect of interlayer thickness (tIL) on recording performance of the media showing relatively close to coherent switching behavior is investigated. The range of t IL was widely controlled from 20 to 45 nm by inserting an amorphous CrTa filling layer between NiW(6 nm)/Ru(14 nm) and amorphous FeCoTaZr soft underlayer (SUL). Minor heating effects at a thicker CrTa on a glass substrate are detected, but the change in magnetic properties and microstructure even at tIL= 45 nm is small enough to study the head-to-SUL spacing effect. A thinner IL clearly improves both reverse overwrite (ROW) and signal-to-noise (SoNR2T) at 2 T, but it reduces resolution (RES). Less dependence of magnetic core width (MCW) on t IL is shown due to compensation of wider magnetic write width (MWW) and narrower erasure band (EB) at a thinner IL. According to simulation results, a thinner IL enhances field strength underneath the center of the writer and more field penetration into the media but the maximum effective field located near the gap changes very little. These field profiles improve writeability at low frequencies, but they do not affect much at mid-to-high frequencies. This situation can explain better ROW, lower RES, and wider MWW at a thinner IL. Higher crosstrack field gradient at a thinner IL corresponds to narrower EB. The improvement of SoNR2T at a thinner IL is caused by the increase in signal at low frequency and the further decrease in dc noise. All the recording parameters with increasing t IL are qualitatively consistent with simulation results.},

  pages={798-810},
  abstract={SPICE offers an accurate method of simulating defect behavior. However, as demonstrated by recent research, it requires long computation time to simulate defect behavior, when considering process variation. To the best of our knowledge, there is no efficient variation-aware delay fault simulation methodology for resistive opens and resistive bridges. This paper presents a fast and accurate delay fault simulation methodology for these two defects. It is fast because it speeds up delay fault computation time by employing two efficient algorithms. The first algorithm is used to calculate transient gate output voltage, which is a key variable needed to compute delay faults. It employs a three step strategy to accelerate the computation of transient gate output voltage without compromising accuracy. The second algorithm uses bisection method to efficiently compute delay fault behavior of a fault-site. The proposed methodology (PM) has been incorporated in an open-source SPICE (NGSPICE) with BSIM4.7 transistor model. The methodology has been validated by comparing results with HSPICE using industrial designs from IWLS 2005 benchmarks and realistic fault-sites have been extracted from synthesized designs. Simulations are carried out using a 65-nm gate library (for illustration). When compared with HSPICE, results show that the PM is on average up to 52-times faster with  ${\leq}{4.2\%}$  error in accuracy for resistive open and 39-times faster with  ${\leq}{5.2\%}$  error in accuracy for resistive bridge defects.},

  abstract={The operation of transistorized Marx-bank circuits (MBCs) is analyzed, and physics-based modeling is used to understand the anomalous switching behavior of the first stage single trigger avalanche transistors of MBCs at high-current-injection conditions. The role of a voltage trigger pulse having variable rise time when applied to the base terminal is investigated to model the underlying physics of the anomalous switching behavior. Experimental observations related to ultrafast anomalous switching mechanisms of trigger transistor, i.e., either primary breakdown or current mode secondary breakdown, for faster and slower base drives are presented. This demonstrates the importance of the dynamic avalanche process and reverse saturation current on the switching mechanism under high-speed base-trigger ramps for different avalanche BJTs from various manufacturers and different lots. The agreement between 2-D TCAD device simulation results and the experimental observations shows the validity of the proposed theory when the base width and mobile carrier recombination rate are used as parameters in the device simulation setup.},

  abstract={To advance sustainable development and achieve carbon neutrality, promoting renewable energy and electric vehicles are essential. Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology plays a crucial role in integrating energy and mobility sectors. The uniqueness of V2G system lies in their diverse user base, whose behaviors significantly influence the system’s effectiveness and operational efficiency. However, existing V2G potential studies often overlook the behavioral characteristics of individual users and their responses to policies and system rules. Our research aims to analyze the potential of V2G systems with a focus on user behavior and the impact of policies and system rules at the city level. We propose a new framework that places user behavior at the core of V2G system analysis. Based on this framework, we developed an Agent-Based Model (ABM). Using ABM, we analyzed the potential of V2G, with Tokyo, Japan, as a case study. This city-scale assessment revealed the significant impact of user behavior on V2G efficiency and the inherent uncertainties. Notably, we observed that as the user base expands, system uncertainties diminish, making the overall system uncertainty negligible in larger user pools.},

  abstract={Some dynamical behaviors of fractional-order commutative quaternion-valued neural networks (FCQVNNs) are studied in this paper. First, because the commutative quaternion does not satisfy Schwartz triangle inequality, the FCQVNNs are divided into four real-valued neural networks (RVNNs) through quaternion commutative multiplication rules. Furthermore, several types of dynamical behaviors including global Mittag-Leffler stability, the boundedness with bounded disturbances, complete synchronization and quasi-synchronization of FCQVNNs are studied. Simultaneously, several conditions for these dynamical behaviors are driven by fractional-order Lyapunov direct method, some inequality techniques and fractional differential equation theory. At last, the effectiveness and feasibility of the obtained theoretical results are verified by several numerical simulation examples.},

  abstract={A large series of studies on evolving agents to play mathematical games has demonstrated that many factors can significantly impact which agents arise, when those agents arise during evolution, and how robust they are in their play against other agents.

This study demonstrates the impact or representation and agent resource allocation for a new game called coordination prisoner's dilemma. This paper demonstrates protocols from a recently published book for analysis of agent behavior and extends the work to another game, the first three-move game so treated. A new representation for agents playing mathematical games is introduced, a linear genetic programming register machine. New metrics for agent behavior including total exploitation, strategic variability, and action entropy are introduced. It is found that varying the representation and resource levels within a representation changes the types of game playing agents produced by evolution for coordination prisoner's dilemma.},

While intentionally limited, the system is very efficient, is very easily interfaced to perceptual and motor control systems, does not require the translation or fusion of sensory representations into a uniform interlingua, and is implementable in feed-forward parallel hardware. We present two implementations of role passing: a simple natural language system that answers questions using a real-time implementation of current theories of biological visual attention, and a robot that can approach, grab, carry, and/or deliver designated objects to designated locations.},

  abstract={Transportation systems design might be supported by participatory approaches refining service design, user experiences, and safety research. The evaluation of mobility alternatives as design improvement strategies requires more advanced instructional techniques with new structures of complexity that can demonstrate, analyze, or compare system performances in order to achieve environmental sustainability in general and the well-being of the end-users in particular. As an emerging technology, games are capable of representing operations and management of passenger freight transportation and increase situational awareness of capacity bottlenecks. However, few research efforts have been devoted to the synthesis of the research progress. Based on the profiling methodology that has been previously employed in retrospect of healthcare simulations, this article presents a bibliometric review of games for health in transportation systems. The study carries out a literature analysis of the modelling methods to assemble gamified scenarios from a planning and managerial perspective. The Web of Science Core Collections are used to identify research items and investigate all the game-based studies in the cross-disciplinary research area of transportation and public health. The technology, game mechanism, and the health-related issue addressed are grouped into broad categories. The research findings are three-fold. (1) The majority of publications are classified into research efforts revolving around slow and road transportation modes. (2) Although scores, badges, and challenges are considered as the frequently seen gamification features, environmental simulation, avatars, and narratives appear as game mechanisms for the activation of the individual decision-making process. (3) Introducing system dynamics, human-computer interaction design, and a stakeholder accountability framework into the multi-stakeholder simulation setting leverages gaming outcomes with health benefits amid transportation system end-users. The literature study concludes with an integrated framework summarizing the best design practices between 2002 and 2022 on how the lessons learned from serious gameplay in virtual environments could translate into real mobility improvements. A selection of future research questions is curated to envisage new links between transportation and health research communities.},

  abstract={Understanding the environment is crucial for autonomous robots to perform navigation and manipulation tasks. Never-seen-before objects may have complex appearances and dynamics, where only physical interactions can help to identify visually hidden properties like mass or friction. In this work we propose a baseline for the newly defined problem of using physical interactions to discover unknown properties of objects, without prior knowledge of them or any supervision. The agent first uses intrinsically motivated unsupervised reinforcement learning to learn how to interact with objects, so as to get observations with a level of information which eases the physical properties estimation. A self-supervised predictive task is then set up while following the learned behaviour to extract a latent representation of the physical properties of an object. When applied to a simulated mobile robot in presence of varying objects, the proposed baseline identifies and differentiates categorical properties, e.g. shape, and quantifies continuous properties, e.g. mass and friction, with excellent correlations to their true values even from noisy observations. It achieves significantly better results than simple interactions of a policy that performs poor exploration. This work provides an implementation of a functional, object-oriented action-perception cycle for embodied robotic agents.},

  year={2024},

  pages={16048-16058},
  abstract={Due to the universal existence of human subgroups in reality, an increasing number of studies have incorporated them into the modeling process of crowd evacuation. However, such models seldom explain subgroup behaviors from the aspect of what individuals see and how they respond to visual input. Here, we propose a vision-driven model based on cognitive heuristics, in which the mechanisms of avoidance with the environment and attraction to other members within the field of view are explicitly clarified. Numerical simulations demonstrate that various spatial characteristics of subgroup members can be effectively represented by this model, and both the intensity and heterogeneity of spatial cohesion have significant impacts on subgroup evacuation. By comparing with an empirical study, the reproducibility of our model has been validated in terms of the temporal and spatial dimensions. This model produces more natural and realistic subgroup behaviors in multiple interaction contexts than existing models, and also quantitatively exhibits the superiority in reproduction effects. Overall, this work provides an interpretable mathematical framework for modeling subgroups from the perspective of visual perception.},

The research utilizes orthogonal arrays in combination with regression analysis to systematically test the parameter space of an engineered system function. We explored the parameter space of interest and detected where the system model does not comply with a defined measure of effectiveness. The findings from this case study suggest that these methods enable a systematic exploration of the system's parameter space, allowing for the effective detection of detrimental weak emergent behavior. This approach potentially enhances test coverage, expands system operating knowledge and facilitates mitigation efforts more efficiently.},

  pages={2056-2070},
  abstract={Episodic memories are constructed from sequences of events. When recalling such a memory, we not only recall individual events, but we also retrieve information about how the sequence of events unfolded. Here, we focus on the role of the hippocampal–entorhinal region in processing and remembering sequences of events, which are thought to be stored in relational networks. We summarize evidence that temporal relations are a central organizational principle for memories in the hippocampus. Importantly, we incorporate novel insights from recent studies about the role of the adjacent entorhinal cortex in sequence memory. In rodents, the lateral entorhinal subregion carries temporal information during ongoing behavior. The human homologue is recruited during memory recall where its representations reflect the temporal relationships between events encountered in a sequence. We further introduce the idea that the hippocampal–entorhinal region might enable temporal scaling of sequence representations. Flexible changes of sequence progression speed could underlie the traversal of episodic memories and mental simulations at different paces. In conclusion, we describe how the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus contribute to remembering event sequences—a core component of episodic memory.},

The minimeli simulation with which the motion-tracking controllers were evolved (along with the rest of the evolutionary machinery) is then described.

Most of these straightforward reinforcement-learning approaches, however, scale poorly to more complex multi-agent learning problems, because the state space for each learning agent grows exponentially in the number of its partner agents engaged in the joint task. In this paper, we consider the Pursuit Problem as a multi-agent learning problem which is computationally intractable by these straightforward approaches. We show how successfully a collection of modular Q-learning hunter agents synthesize coordinated decision policies needed to capture a randomly-fleeing prey agent effectively, by specializing their individual functionality and organizing herding behavior.},

  abstract={There is an analogy between animal andproduct design that can be formulated as an exact mathematical analogy. The success of a biological design is measured by the success of the genes that produce it, and this depends upon the ability of those genes to increase their representation in the population in the face of competition from rival genes. Similarly, when a variety of products is under consideration, they vary in the period required for product development, in the chance of failure in the market place, and in the expected returns from sales if the product is successful. The development period refers to the period before any return is achieved on investment. For animals this is the period between birth and reproduction, and for products it is the period prior to time that financial return accrues to the investor. The success of a design is evaluated by the netrate of increase of the genes coding for it (i.e. the return on investment) in the animal case, or, in the case of a product launched into the marketplace, of themoney invested in it. If we are to take the biological approach to robot design seriously. then we should first consider the ecological (or market) niche that a proposed robot is to occupy. Is the robot to be a toy, a brick-laying robot, or a bomb-disposal robot? Justas there arcno general-purpose animals, so there shouldbe no general-purpose moots. For robot behaviour to be adaptive. in terms of the analogy, it mustoptimise with respect to the selective pressures of the market place. Other forms of adaptation, such as acclimatisation and learning, are subject to the same criteria.},

  abstract={There has been much prescriptive work in project management, exemplified in various "Bodies of Knowledge". However, experience shows some projects overspending considerably. Recently, systemic modeling research into the behavior of large projects explains project oversponds by "systemic" effects and the (sometimes counterintuitive) effect of management actions. However, while this work is becoming more widely known, embedding the lessons in project-management practice is not straightforward. The current prescriptive dominant discourse of project management contains implicit underlying assumptions with which the systemic modeling work clashes, indeed showing how conventional methods can exacerbate rather than alleviate project problems. Exploration of this modeling suggests that for projects that are complex, uncertain, and time-limited, conventional methods might be inappropriate, and aspects of newer methodologies in which the project "emerges" rather than being fully preplanned might be more appropriate. Some of the current literature on project-classification schemes also suggests similar parameters, without the rationale that the systemic modeling provides, thus providing useful backup to this analysis. The eventual aim of this line of work is to enable project managers to choose effective ways to manage projects based on understanding and model-based theory.},

The parasitic resistance and effective channel length characteristics exhibit similar behavior with that of crystalline silicon metal oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (c-Si MOSFET) that has doped S/D bulk region. The transfer curves little changed with gate overlap variation, and the width-normalized parasitic resistance obtained from transmission line method was as low as 3 to 6 Omegamiddotcm. The effective channel length was shorter than the mask channel length and showed gate-to-source (VGS) voltage dependency that is frequently observed for lightly doped drain (LDD) MOSFET. Experimental and simulation results showed that the plasma exposure caused an LDD-like doping effect in the S/D bulk region by inducing oxygen vacancy in the a-IGZO layer.},

  year={1999},
  volume={25},

  pages={619-632},
  abstract={This paper presents a hierarchical simulation methodology that enables accurate system evaluation under realistic faults and conditions. In this methodology, effects of low-level (i.e., transistor or circuit level) faults are propagated to higher levels (i.e., system level) using fault dictionaries. The primary fault models are obtained via simulation of the transistor-level effect of a radiation particle penetrating a device. The resulting current bursts constitute the first-level fault dictionary and are used in the circuit-level simulation to determine the impact on circuit latches and flip-flops. The latched outputs constitute the next level fault dictionary in the hierarchy and are applied in conducting fault injection simulation at the chip-level under selected workloads or application programs. Faults injected at the chip-level result in memory corruptions, which are used to form the next level fault dictionary for the system-level simulation of an application running on simulated hardware. When an application terminates, either normally or abnormally, the overall fault impact on the software behavior is quantified and analyzed. The system in this sense can be a single workstation or a network. The simulation method is demonstrated and validated in the case study of Myrinet (a commercial, high-speed network) based network system.},

  abstract={Nowadays, the lithium-ion battery (LIB) has been widely used as an energy source for electric vehicles or the auxiliary power supply for rail transit. However, the sensitivity of LIB to temperature greatly limits its application condition. Due to internal impedance and entropy change, temperature of LIB varies during charging and discharging. This variation conversely affects the electrical characteristics of batteries, and then the heat generation rate. In order to accurately model this coupled thermoelectric process of the lithium-ion battery, a co-simulation method based on coupled thermoelectric model is developed in this paper, which combines equivalent circuit model (ECM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software. For purpose of verifying the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method, Experiments are performed at different temperatures and C-rates conditions, using a large-format pouch cell applied in rail transit projects. The comparison indicates that this method joined with temperature correction has higher accuracy than the traditional thermal simulation without temperature correction and the simulated result shows good agreement with measurements.},

  abstract={Will Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Highly Automated Driving (HAD) perform in the expected manner? Will they actually make road traffic safer, or will they potentially introduce new critical situations or road accidents? It is almost impossible to address these questions solely through real-world tests. A promising tool to provide appropriate answers in a time- and cost-efficient way without exposing subjects to risk are virtual assessment methods. Reliable safety assessments are only possible, if the traffic simulations provide realistic traffic, including critical situations and road accidents. This paper provides a review of how human error contributes to critical situations and accidents in road traffic. The focus is on the causes and mechanisms of human error, which driver behavior models must address in order to simulate realistic traffic. For this purpose, Rasmussen’s error taxonomies are applied to the traffic context and extended with further research. The paper shows the causes of those human errors and that the underlying mechanisms thereof should be taken into account in order to obtain more transparent and realistic driver behavior models. It is shown, which concepts for modelling realistic traffic exist and how virtual safety assessment could benefit from this development. In addition, the driver behavior model DReaM (Driver Reaction Model) is presented to address the issues resulting from existing cognitive driver models.},

  year={2013},
  volume={58},
  number={2},
  pages={539-544},
  abstract={The dynamics of many systems nowadays follow not only physical laws but also man-made rules. These systems are known as discrete event dynamic systems and their performances can be accurately evaluated only through simulations. Existing studies on simulation-based optimization (SBO) usually assume deterministic simulation time for each replication. However, in many applications such as evacuation, smoke detection, and territory exploration, the simulation time is stochastic due to the randomness in the system behavior. We consider the computing budget allocation for SBOs with stochastic simulation time in this technical note, which has not been addressed in existing literatures to the author's best knowledge. We make the following major contribution. The relationship between simulation time and performance estimation accuracy is quantified. It is shown that when the asymptotic performance is of interest only the mean value of individual simulation time matters. Then based on the existing optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA) method for deterministic simulation time we develop OCBA for stochastic simulation time (OCBAS), and show that OCBAS is asymptotically optimal. Numerical experiments are used to discuss the impact of the variance of simulation time, the impact of correlated simulation time and performance estimation, and to demonstrate the performance of OCBAS on a smoke detection problem in wireless sensor network. The numerical results also show that OCBA for deterministic simulation time is robust even when the simulation time is stochastic.},

  abstract={Power densities in modern processors induce thermal issues that limit performance. Power and thermal models add complexity to architectural simulators, limiting the depth of analysis. Prohibitive execution time overheads may be circumvented using sampling techniques. While these approaches work well when characterizing processor performance, they introduce new challenges when applied to the thermal domain. This paper aims to improve the accuracy and performance of sampled thermal simulation at the architectural level. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to evaluate the impact of statistical sampling on thermal metrics through direct temperature measurements performed at runtime. Experiments confirm that sampling can accurately estimate certain thermal metrics. However, extra consideration needs to be taken into account to preserve the accuracy of temperature estimation in a sampled simulation. Mainly because, on average, thermal phases are much longer than performance phases. Based on these insights, we introduce a framework that extends statistical sampling techniques, used at the performance and power stages, to the thermal domain. The resulting technique yields an integrated performance, power, and temperature simulator that maintains accuracy, while reducing simulation time by orders of magnitude. In particular, this paper shows how dynamic frequency and voltage adaptations can be evaluated in a statistically sampled simulation. We conclude by showing how the increased simulation speed benefits architects in the exploration of the design space.},

  abstract={A novel single-shot trapezoidal-gradient-based Lissajous trajectory is described and implemented on a 3-tesla magnetic resonance (MR) scanner. A feature of this trajectory is that its sampling points are located on a nonequidistant rectangular grid, which permits the usage of one-dimensional optimal algorithms to increase the robustness and speed of image reconstruction. Another advantage of the trajectory is that two images with different effective echo times can be obtained within a single excitation, which might be used for fast T/sub 2//sup */ mapping, in functional MR imaging scanning of brain activity associated with mental processes. Potential artifacts in reconstructed images were investigated and methods for suppressing these artifacts were developed. Experiments on normal subjects at rest and during brain activation were performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the new sequence.},

  year={2020},
  volume={62},
  number={1},
  pages={25-35},
  abstract={System-level electrostatic discharge (ESD) robustness design according to ISO10605 or IEC 61000-4-2 on printed circuit board (PCB) level is still a challenge). The blocking point is often the lack of accurate models of complete integrated circuits (ICs). Previously published methodologies to generate ESD models for ICs are all based on measurements of the complete IC, showing the drawback of complex, difficult and time-consuming measurements. This paper proposes a novel methodology to generate ESD models for complete ICs out of their design data. The proposed approach requires no measurements with the complete IC and hence can reduce the effort significantly. Furthermore, the methodology offers the possibility for automation, which further reduces the number of needed resources. It is based on the approach of black box modeling. This means simplified behavioral models are used, which contain solely the characteristic behavior in case of disturbance pulses. The methodology focuses on the transient behavior as well as the physical destruction limits of smart power products. Behavioral model in this context means the transient response due to disturbance pulse in terms of voltage drops and current drain. The procedure is explained and verified step by step on an exemplary product. It can be easily transferred to other products. System designers receive a powerful model for targeting certain robustness of their system against transient disturbances. Further enhancements of the methodology can enable also the soft failure assessment by simulation.},

  abstract={Autonomous systems are making their way to the market. The transition from tasks performed by humans to tasks performed by machines begs for an answer to one of the most challenging questions in this area of research: Will humans understand and trust what a machine does? Analyzing human and machine behaviors offers the foundational steps toward finding answers to this question. This paper contributes a novel methodology for transforming low-level actions by each agent into high-level categorization of strategies to contrast the behaviors of humans and machines using a computational red teaming environment with a red (evader) and a blue (pursuer) agent. Two orthogonal sources of uncertainty were examined: the uncertainty in the blue agent's situation awareness about the red, and the red agent's uncertainty resulting from deceptive actions by the blue. For each uncertainty source, two different experiments were conducted by varying the controller of the red agent. In one experiment, the red agent was controlled by one of the 34 human subjects; and in the second, by an evolved neural network. The blue agent was controlled by a scripted rule-based system. In this time-critical task, the results revealed that humans tend to follow systemic and consistent strategies, sometimes ignoring the information available to them. On the other hand, machines tend to evolve more complex and diverse strategies. This finding calls for new computational intelligence techniques to enable the fusion of these different strategies into forms that each party can understand and use effectively.},

  abstract={The impact of social media on teens’ mental health and development raises the need for educational interventions that equip them with the knowledge and skills to cope with dangerous situations. In spite of the growing effort to expand social media literacy among youngsters, social media interventions still rely on conventional methods that tend to prioritize cognitive skills while overlooking important socio-emotional competencies. To bridge this gap and offer innovative solutions to social media education, this article presents the narrative scripts (NS) approach implemented in a learning technology environment that integrates pedagogical strategies of authentic learning, narratives, and scripted collaborative learning within a simulated educational social media platform. A longitudinal study with 370 high school students in urban schools in Barcelona (Spain) was designed to assess NS in an intervention to foster the development of social media self-protection skills. The findings demonstrated that NS supported the development of social media self-protection skills, while the students expressed positive perceptions of their overall learning experience. The intervention notably enhanced the socio-emotional competencies of responsible decision-making, self-awareness, and social awareness. This research makes a valuable contribution to the design and development of technology aimed at facilitating authentic learning experiences for social media education, with a specific focus on interventions targeting socio-emotional competencies.},

  abstract={As Internet technology undergoes rapid development and widespread adoption, e-commerce emerges as a pivotal component of the platform economy, permeating various facets of daily life. However, due to the influence of time, space, and other factors, the problem of integrity becomes severe in the real trading environment. As the platforms, sellers, and consumers are the main participants and their decision-making is restricted by historical experiences and contextual conditions, they exhibit constrained rationality. Utilizing evolutionary game theory, the study constructs a tripartite game model that analyses the influence of relevant parameters on the behavior of the participants. To deal with the behaviors of the participants, we built a simulation system on MATLAB to demonstrate the effects of beginning circumstances and associated parameter adjustments on the evolution outcomes for participants. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation analysis, we identify that the e-commerce platforms should standardize the good faith behavior of sellers by increasing the punishment, which can reduce the malicious return behavior of consumers. Sellers can mitigate the probability of fraud by improving production technology. Consumers can improve their learning to avoid returning products. This research provides a theoretical framework and decision support for e-commerce platforms, and it also promotes the long-term growth of online transactions.},

  year={2023},

  pages={2874-2887},
  abstract={An open problem in autonomous vehicle safety validation is building reliable models of human driving behavior in simulation. This work presents an approach to learn neural driving policies from real world driving demonstration data. We model human driving as a sequential decision making problem that is characterized by non-linearity and stochasticity, and unknown underlying cost functions. Imitation learning is an approach for generating intelligent behavior when the cost function is unknown or difficult to specify. Building upon work in inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) aims to provide effective imitation even for problems with large or continuous state and action spaces, such as modeling human driving. This article describes the use of GAIL for learning-based driver modeling. Because driver modeling is inherently a multi-agent problem, where the interaction between agents needs to be modeled, this paper describes a parameter-sharing extension of GAIL called PS-GAIL to tackle multi-agent driver modeling. In addition, GAIL is domain agnostic, making it difficult to encode specific knowledge relevant to driving in the learning process. This paper describes Reward Augmented Imitation Learning (RAIL), which modifies the reward signal to provide domain-specific knowledge to the agent. Finally, human demonstrations are dependent upon latent factors that may not be captured by GAIL. This paper describes Burn-InfoGAIL, which allows for disentanglement of latent variability in demonstrations. Imitation learning experiments are performed using NGSIM, a real-world highway driving dataset. Experiments show that these modifications to GAIL can successfully model highway driving behavior, accurately replicating human demonstrations and generating realistic, emergent behavior in the traffic flow arising from the interaction between driving agents.},

  abstract={Simulation emergency evacuation is an important part in the field of safety engineering, affective computing plays a vital role in the popularization of artificial intelligence, computer simulation and human-computer interaction. Inspired by this field, this paper proposes a method for simulating group interactions during emergency evacuation. First, each individual is assigned with dynamic survival needs and psychological quality based on urgent event and the external influence. Second, the emotional interaction of the group is realized based on OCEAN (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) personality trait and the improved CA-SIRS (Cellular Automaton-Susceptible Infected Recovered Susceptible) model. Third, after the perception of the external environment changes, the accident experience and panic level are used as factors of emotion update. At last, the environmental familiarity and nearby flow factors are introduced to path planning process. Based on emotion contagion, this method explores individual's emotional changes in different scenarios and situations. Combined with personality traits and emotional contagion, the experimental results show that the proposed method can simulate dynamic emotional changes in emergency situations in both efficient and reasonable way and provide guidance for emergency evacuation.},

  abstract={Safety is a primary concern for the various transport means. For sea transport, this includes various aspects like human safety at sea and at port, and also environmental safety and sustainability. In heavy-traffic regions where the waters are congested and vessels sail very closely together, ensuring these safety needs can be challenging. In this paper, we leverage on the rich information transmitted through the automatic identification system (AIS) and propose, for the first time, an integrated simulation-optimization approach for real time collision avoidance. This enables capturing of stochastic dynamic behavior of vessels for better prediction and fast trajectory optimization for application in real time. Specifically, a realistic agent-based model is developed based on behavioral learning in a real-environment, and incorporated into a fast collision avoidance optimization model in real time to provide robust collision avoidance that is able to account for future stochastic consequences of the actions taken. To achieve this, we develop: 1) a vessel pattern recognition method that mines the rich AIS data to produce realistic trajectory models; 2) an agent-based simulation model to enhance future trajectory prediction; and 3) a fast surrogate-based sampling technique to generate collision avoidance maneuvers for vessel captains in real time. To illustrate the feasibility of the approach, we use the case of the Singapore strait, one of the busiest straits in the world.},

This paper deals with the development of an adaptive electrokinematical simulation to adapt the kinematical behavior of the system according to its limitations. A flexible simulation tool is thus obtained by taking into account electrical, mechanical, as well as kinematical limitations. This tool is validated by experimental results on a real railway track. It is then used to study different solutions to increase the transport capacity of a subway system, even when limitations occur.},

Computer simulation is a widely adopted technique to study crowd evacuations and help design reasonable emergence plans due to its flexibility, convenience, and cost-effectiveness. In this paper, we propose ECEM, a novel evacuation model based on agent simulation. In ECEM, we consider a special individual behavior in the evacuation, called seeking behavior, which happens when relatives or friends (i.e., social groups) are in the crowd, and the members within a group may tend to seek each other once separated instead of evacuating alone. Moreover, we incorporate the crowd chaos based on Boltzmann entropy (i.e., crowd entropy) into ECEM to measure the evacuating population’s disorder level and present an adaptive velocity smoothing method using crowd entropy for updating individual’s velocity. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of ECEM and provide several insights on designing the evacuation strategies.},

  abstract={Deep learning (DL) technologies have been widely investigated to improve the performance of microwave device behavior prediction. Advanced microwave-related DL technologies utilize independent computers to collect data from the electronic design automation (EDA) software. However, it is essential to note that DL requires a vast amount of high-quality training data. Collecting these data from exact simulation meticulous optimization in EDA is exceptionally time-consuming and computationally intensive. A straightforward way to speed up the process is by collecting quality data from distributed radio frequency (RF) designers. However, this approach may not always be feasible due to the need to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive microwave design information. In this letter, we proposed a federated learning (FL) framework for corporately training DL models for microwave filter behavior prediction. The FL framework aggregates knowledge from various designers without sharing their raw data. The primary experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed encrypted FL framework for microwave filter applications with superior accuracy and speed.},

  abstract={Traffic simulation plays a crucial role in evaluating and improving autonomous driving planning systems. After being deployed on public roads, autonomous vehicles need to interact with human road participants with different social preferences (e.g., selfish or courteous human drivers). To ensure that autonomous vehicles take safe and efficient maneuvers in different interactive traffic scenarios, we should be able to evaluate autonomous vehicles against reactive agents with different social characteristics in the simulation environment. We propose a socially-controllable behavior generation (SCBG) model for this purpose, which allows the users to specify the level of courtesy of the generated trajectory while ensuring realistic and human-like trajectory generation through learning from real-world driving data. Specifically, we define a novel and differentiable measure to quantify the level of courtesy of driving behavior, leveraging marginal and conditional behavior prediction models trained from real-world driving data. The proposed courtesy measure allows us to auto-label the courtesy levels of trajectories from real-world driving data and conveniently train an SCBG model generating trajectories based on the input courtesy values. We examine SCBG on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and show that we are able to control the SCBG model to generate realistic driving behaviors with desired courtesy levels. In particular, we find that SCBG is able to identify different motion patterns of courteous behaviors according to the scenarios.},

  abstract={Trends in power system simulation that demand computationally-intensive, physics-based models may impede the acquisition of useful results for applications like condition-based maintenance, electrical plant load analysis (EPLA), and the scheduling and tasking of finite generation and distribution resources. A tool that can quickly evaluate many scenarios, as opposed to intense, high fidelity modeling of a single operating scenario, may best serve these applications. This paper presents a behavioral simulator that can quickly emulate the operation of a relatively large collection of electrical loads, providing “what-if” evaluations of various operating scenarios and conditions for more complete exploration of a design or plant operating envelope. The presented simulator can provide time-series data of power system operation under loading conditions and usage assumptions of interest. Comparisons to field data collected from a microgrid on-board a 270-foot (82 meter) US Coast Guard medium-endurance cutter demonstrate the utility of this tool and approach.},

  abstract={The reliability and security of distributed detection systems have become increasingly important due to their growing prevalence in various applications. As advancements in human-machine systems continue, human factors, such as herding behaviors, are becoming influential in decision fusion process of these systems. The presence of malicious users further highlights the necessity to mitigate security concerns. In this paper, we propose a maximum entropy attack exploring the herding behaviors of users to amplify the hazard of attackers. Different from prior works that try to maximize the fusion error rate, the proposed attack maximizes the entropy of inferred system states from the fusion center, making the fusion results the same as a random coin toss. Moreover, we design static and dynamic attack modes to maximize the entropy of fusion results at the steady state and during the dynamic evolution stage, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed attack strategy can cause the fusion accuracy to hover around 50% and existing fusion rules cannot resist our proposed attack, demonstrating its effectiveness.},

  pages={834-841},
  abstract={A new non-quasi-static (NQS) MOSFET model, which is applicable for both large-signal transient and small-signal ac analysis, has been developed. It employs a physical relaxation time approach to take care of the finite channel charging time to reach equilibrium and the effect of instantaneous channel charge re-distribution. The NQS model is formulated independently from the dc I-V and the charge-capacitor model, thus can be easily applied to any existing simulators. The model has been implemented in the newly released BSIM3 version 3, and comparison has been made among this model, common quasi-static (QS) SPICE models and PISCES two-dimensional (2-D) numerical device simulator. While predicting accurate NQS behavior, the time penalty for using the new model is only about 20-30% more than the common QS models. It is much less than the time required by other NQS models reported. Limitations and compromises between simplicity, efficiency and accuracy are also discussed.},

Recent advances in deep learning studies have complemented existing RL methods and led to a crucial breakthrough in the effort of applying RL to automation and robotics. Artificial agents based on deep RL can take selective and intelligent actions comparable with those of a human to maximize the feedback reward from the interactive environment. In this paper, we survey recent developments in the literature regarding deep RL methods for building human-level agents. As a result, prominent studies that involve modeling every aspect of a human-level agent will be examined. We also provide an overview of constructing a framework for prospective autonomous systems. Moreover, various toolkits and frameworks are suggested to facilitate the development of deep RL methods. Finally, we open a discussion that potentially raises a range of future research directions in deep RL.},

  abstract={Facing and pointing toward moving targets is a usual and natural behavior in daily life. Social robots should be able to display such coordinated behaviors in order to interact naturally with people. For instance, a robot should be able to point and look at specific objects. This is why, a scheme to generate coordinated head-arm motion for a humanoid robot with two degrees-of-freedom for the head and seven for each arm is proposed in this paper. Specifically, a virtual plane approach is employed to generate the analytical solution of the head motion. A quadratic program (QP)-based method is exploited to formulate the coordinated dual-arm motion. To obtain the optimal solution, a simplified recurrent neural network is used to solve the QP problem. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated using both computer simulation and physical experiments.},

  abstract={Facing the gradual ageing society, elderly people living independently are in need of serious attention. In order to assist them to live in a safer environment, the increasing cost of nursing care and the shortage of health-care workers urges the demand of home-based assisted living in recent times. Therefore, home-based health-care has become an active research domain, particularly the abnormal activities detection involving information and communications technologies. This survey paper highlights this kind of technologies that exist for human anomalous behavior detection. It also reviews and discusses the current research trends, their outcomes and effects in elderly care. Our study is mainly focused on dense sensing network based activities and anomaly detection, which are robust to environment change, non-intrusive, user-friendly in the sense that do not require the occupant to wear any devices. From our study, we observe that employing sensor fusion techniques could significantly increases the efficiency of dense sensing network. In addition, sensor fusion models ensure a high level of robustness and effectiveness compared to the traditional methods.},

  abstract={This paper discusses an efficient method to analyze the spatial and temporal reliability of analog and digital circuits. First, a SPICE-based reliability simulator with automatic step-size control is proposed. Both hot carrier degradation and negative bias temperature instability are included in the simulator. Next, a method to analyze the interaction between process variability effects and circuit aging is introduced. This method is based on a screening experimental design (DoE) succeeded by a set of regression DoEs, resulting in a good speed-accuracy tradeoff with a nearly linear complexity for all circuits under test. Finally, based on the DoE analysis, a circuit response surface model (RSM) is derived. The RSM is used for further circuit reliability analysis such as circuit weak spot detection and yield calculation as a function of circuit lifetime. The proposed method is validated over a broad range of both analog and digital circuits. Yield simulation time is reduced with up to three orders of magnitude, when compared to standard Monte Carlo-based techniques and while still maintaining simulation accuracy.},

  pages={95-100},
  abstract={Reliability and lifetime of high power laser arrays are governed by their thermal properties. Thus the understanding of the thermal behavior such as thermal transients as well as the optimization of laser chips and mounting are key features for obtaining improved devices. We present numerical simulations of the active layer temperature employing the finite element method (FEM). Both continuous wave (cw) operation and thermal transients are modeled within a unified theoretical concept, which basically connects a balanced equation model that provides information on the temperature dependence of the loss mechanisms, such as spontaneous emission, Auger and surface recombination with a 2 dimensional FEM model. For a given laser array architecture we calculated the effect of the introduction of different heat spreader materials such as copper, silicon and diamond, Furthermore, different array designs such as broad area devices and stripe arrays having different output power (cw: 1-10 W) are numerically described. These results are compared with experimental data on the averaged temperature of the optically active layer. The temperature values are determined from the spectral shift of the emission spectrum of the array at a certain time windows after applying the operation current. Both experimental and theoretical results are compared from the 10 ns to the cw range. Thus both the theoretical description concept as well as the parameter set used for the calculation are carefully tested. Remarkable agreement between calculated and measured thermal transients was found. Additionally, the very divergent temporal behavior of special array structures was verified coincidentally by theory and experiment.},

  year={2018},
  volume={48},
  number={6},
  pages={592-603},
  abstract={For a driving simulator to be a valid tool for research, vehicle development, or driver training, it is crucial that it elicits similar driver behavior as the corresponding real vehicle. To assess such behavioral validity, the use of quantitative driver models has been suggested but not previously reported. Here, a task-general conceptual driver model is proposed, along with a taxonomy defining levels of behavioral validity. Based on these theoretical concepts, it is argued that driver models without explicit representations of sensory or neuromuscular dynamics should be sufficient for a model-based assessment of driving simulators in most contexts. As a task-specific example, two parsimonious driver steering models of this nature are developed and tested on a dataset of real and simulated driving in near-limit, low-friction circumstances, indicating a clear preference of one model over the other. By means of closed-loop simulations, it is demonstrated that the parameters of this preferred model can generally be accurately estimated from unperturbed driver steering data, using a simple, open-loop fitting method, as long as the vehicle positioning data are reliable. Some recurring patterns between the two studied tasks are noted in how the model's parameters, fitted to human steering, are affected by the presence or absence of steering torques and motion cues in the simulator.},

  abstract={This paper presents an Emotion Network structure for modeling crowd emotions to simulate socially emotional crowds. The emotion model focuses on entire crowds, builds individual emotion spaces as network nodes, embodies psychological linkages with relationship arcs, and clusters emotionally homogeneous crowds into EmotionTrees. According to the maximum value of the emotion component and the psychological distance, crowds are initialized as different trees. With relational distributions of crowd changes, agents move between different subgroups. Then, we construct emotion-oriented commands with subgroup constraints according to intergroup emotion theory. For execution, motion variables are calculated from emotion commands (i.e., emotion source-oriented orientation, and velocity and emotion strength-based motion clip selection). Experiments on bystanders, football fans, violent protestors, and guided marching behaviors demonstrate that the Emotion Network can improve crowd behavior modeling with particular attention to the impacts of group constraints and emotional characteristics, which can reflect environment stimuli and changes. The model can be integrated into physical crowd simulators as a high-level emotion manager, providing intelligent emotional support in improving the realism of human-like crowds.},

  title={A Functional Approach for Analyzing Time-Dependent Driver Response Behavior to Real-World Connected Vehicle Warnings}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={24},
  number={3},
  pages={3438-3447},
  abstract={Understanding driver response behavior to Connected Vehicle (CV) warnings is one of the fundamental tasks in improving road safety. However, previous studies often used aggregated safety measures and simulation environments to accomplish this task. Consequently, time-dependent driver response behavior under real-world conditions has rarely been investigated. This study proposes a new functional data analysis (FDA) approach to analyze time-dependent driver response behavior to CV warnings obtained from the New York City CV Pilot Deployment (NYC CVPD) project. Sparse functional design that can account for irregularly spaced functional measurements is adopted to accommodate the potential noise contaminated real-world CV data. Functional principal component analysis and nonparametric functional linear regression are used to smooth raw driver behavior profile and estimate time-dependent effect of driver response behavior, respectively. The speed compliance application implemented in the NYC CVPD project is used as the case study. By modeling time series of speed data after receiving warnings as continuous functions, the proposed FDA approach reveals new patterns of driver response behavior over time, such as the diminishing effect of drivers’ speed reduction and the increase in variability of driver response behavior over time, which have rarely been explored using traditional approaches. Moreover, the proposed FDA approach supports the extraction of certain traditional safety measures and has the potential to be generalized to analyze various CV applications. The findings of this study can support the calibration of detailed driver behavior in CV environments and facilitate better CV application design and further investigation of the benefits of CVs.},

After describing this method in detail, an amplifier with resistive networks and interdigital transducers using specific input signals was proposed to test the method, and these results agreed when compared with those obtained with a simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis (SPICE)-based program. Besides, the simulation of two oscillators are presented; the first has a feedback network consisting of serial-connected equivalent circuits of crystals, and the second uses a feedback network with a surface acoustic wave (SAW) delay line. For the first oscillator, the waveforms obtained using this method and a SPICE-based program considering two different numerical integration methods were compared, and they looked similar, but all signals have different rise times because these simulations are very sensitive to inherent numerical errors. The simulation of a SAW delay line oscillator and its input and output voltages and currents were obtained, and its fundamental frequency was 77.77 MHz. These simulated results were validated experimentally through the oscillation frequency, which was found using the $-parameters of the amplifier and the delay line and an oscillation criterion, and it was measured directly in the circuit. The experimental oscillation frequencies were 76.9 and 77.5 MHz, respectively, and the errors between simulation and experimentation were approximately 1%.},

  pages={46940-46952},
  abstract={Training task-oriented dialog agents based on reinforcement learning is time-consuming and requires a large number of interactions with real users. How to grasp dialog policy within limited dialog experiences remains an obstacle that makes the agent training process less efficient. In addition, most previous frameworks start training by randomly choosing training samples, which differs from the human learning method and hurts the efficiency and stability of training. Therefore, we propose Scheduled Curiosity-Deep Dyna-Q (SC-DDQ), a curiosity-driven curriculum learning framework based on a state-of- the-art model-based reinforcement learning dialog model, Deep Dyna-Q (DDQ). Furthermore, we design ed learning schedules for SC-DDQ and DDQ, respectively, following two opposite training strategies: classic curriculum learning and its reverse version. Our results show that by introducing scheduled learning and curiosity, the new framework leads to a significant improvement over the DDQ and Deep Q-learning (DQN). Surprisingly, we found that traditional curriculum learning was not always effective. Specifically, according to the experimental results, the easy-first and difficult-first strategies are more suitable for SC-DDQ and DDQ. To analyze our results, we adopt ed the entropy of sampled actions to depict action exploration and found that training strategies with high entropy in the first stage and low entropy in the last stage lead to better performance.},

  abstract={Simulating biological intelligence has been proved to be an effective way to design intelligent robots, and simultaneously can solve the problems existing in machine learning methods. For creatures, their motor skills achieving is the first stage of learning. By combining two important cognitive elements: orientation and curiosity, this article proposes a new neurobiologically-inspired sensorimotor developmental learning method for the mobile robot. In this method, curiosity promotes robot’s exploration of the environment, while orientation enhances robot’s exploitation knowledge of the environment. The orientation cognitive algorithm is designed based on Skinner’s operant conditioning theory, and its rationality is proved. The balance of exploration and exploitation, which is a key problem for all the cognitive learning method, is solved in this method. The developmental learning process can avoid fixed sensorimotor mapping space problem, and help reduce learning waste as well as computing waste. All of the developmental learning method’s characters are finally verified via simulations on a virtual mobile robot.},

  abstract={Vehicle-in-the-loop simulation (VILS) is a vehicle-testing technique that integrates high-fidelity simulation environments with real-world vehicles. Among existing simulation approaches for evaluating autonomous driving systems (ADS), VILS is particularly noteworthy because it faithfully reflects the dynamic characteristics of real-world vehicles and ensures repeatable and reproducible testing in diverse virtual scenarios. While researchers strive to implement a VILS platform that closely approximates real-world vehicle-testing environments, the performance of vehicles in VILS testing may differ from that observed in real-world testing, depending on the platform’s reliability. Therefore, methods must be established to validate the reliability of VILS platforms. Herein, we present the essential components of a VILS platform for evaluating ADS (AD-VILS) and propose a metho dology to validate the reliability of the implemented AD-VILS platform. This methodology includes scenario definition, techniques for VILS testing and real-world vehicle testing, and procedures for evaluating consistency and correlation based on statistical and mathematical comparisons between the datasets from virtual and real-world tests. Moreover, we empirically derive reliability evaluation criteria through iterative testing. This methodology aims to enhance the precision and reliability of ADS evaluations conducted on AD-VILS platforms.},

  abstract={Recent developments in technology have meant that operators of complex systems, such as those found in the modern aircraft cockpit, now have access to an unprecedented volume of information. Significant focus within computer science and engineering has therefore been placed upon developing methods by which task-relevant information can be made as accessible as possible within the interface, thus reducing operator workload—a goal of traditional human factors approaches to interface design. Recent theoretical perspectives of adaptive human cognition [Gray, W.D. and Fu, W.-T. (2004). Soft constraints in interactive behaviour: the case of ignoring perfect knowledge in the world for imperfect knowledge in the head. Cogn. Sci., 28, 359–383] suggest that there is a delicate balance and a series of trade-offs between information access at the interface and resulting human interactive behaviour. A distinction has been drawn between display- and memory-based strategies. Two experiments are reported that investigated the relationship between information access and the selection of cognitive strategy, particularly the effect on learning and memory. Experiment 1 varied the cost of accessing information in a routine copying task, and found that higher access costs (e.g. mouse movement plus 1-s delay) led to the adoption of a memory-based strategy, and better retention of visual-spatial information. Experiment 2 manipulated the availability of fused information in a low-fidelity flight simulation task. Temporarily removing onscreen information similarly improved recall of site location information. The potential benefits are discussed of a novel approach to display design that manipulates information access depending on task performance criteria.},

  abstract={Recent breakthroughs in hierarchical multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (HMADRL) are propelling the development of sophisticated multi-robot systems, particularly in the realm of complex coordination tasks. These advancements hold significant potential for addressing the intricate challenges inherent in fast-evolving sectors such as intelligent manufacturing. In this study, we introduce an innovative simulator tailored for a multi-robot pick-and-place (PnP) operation, built upon the OpenAI Gym framework. Our aim is to demonstrate the efficacy of HMADRL algorithms for multi robot coordination in a manufacturing setting, concentrating on their influence on the gripping rate, a crucial indicator for gauging system performance and operational efficiency.},

  abstract={Dr. Constance Steinkuehler was working on her master's of science degree in educational psychology with a focus on cognitive science when the Internet began to take off. With the Internet entering homes and becoming a mainstay, she started looking at how people learn together and solve problems online. These were the days of chat rooms, and she found it hard to build inspiring problems to work on or sites to work with while in the lab. When she decided to turn her attention to the real world, a professor suggested video games, something Steinkuehler hadn't played since she was "a high schooler hanging out at the arcade," but she took a look and was amazed at the level of sophistication she found. She turned her work toward studying what gamers were doing cognitively and intellectually and what, if anything, children, especially teenagers, were getting out of their play.},

  abstract={Data sculptures are a promising type of visualizations in which data is given a physical form. In the past, they have mostly been used for artistic, communicative or educational purposes, and designers of data sculptures argue that in such situations, physical visualizations can be more enriching than pixel-based visualizations. We present the design of Activity Sculptures: data sculptures of running activity. In a three-week field study we investigated the impact of the sculptures on 14 participants' running activity, the personal and social behaviors generated by the sculptures, as well as participants' experiences when receiving these individual physical tokens generated from the specific data of their runs. The physical rewards generated curiosity and personal experimentation but also social dynamics such as discussion on runs or envy/competition. We argue that such passive (or calm) visualizations can complement nudging and other mechanisms of persuasion with a more playful and reflective look at ones' activity.},

  title={SparkMed: A Framework for Dynamic Integration of Multimedia Medical Data Into Distributed m-Health Systems}, 
  year={2012},
  volume={16},

  abstract={With the advent of 4G and other long-term evolution (LTE) wireless networks, the traditional boundaries of patient record propagation are diminishing as networking technologies extend the reach of hospital infrastructure and provide on-demand mobile access to medical multimedia data. However, due to legacy and proprietary software, storage and decommissioning costs, and the price of centralization and redevelopment, it remains complex, expensive, and often unfeasible for hospitals to deploy their infrastructure for online and mobile use. This paper proposes the SparkMed data integration framework for mobile healthcare (m-Health), which significantly benefits from the enhanced network capabilities of LTE wireless technologies, by enabling a wide range of heterogeneous medical software and database systems (such as the picture archiving and communication systems, hospital information system, and reporting systems) to be dynamically integrated into a cloud-like peer-to-peer multimedia data store. Our framework allows medical data applications to share data with mobile hosts over a wireless network (such as WiFi and 3G), by binding to existing software systems and deploying them as m-Health applications. SparkMed integrates techniques from multimedia streaming, rich Internet applications (RIA), and remote procedure call (RPC) frameworks to construct a Self-managing, Pervasive Automated netwoRK for Medical Enterprise Data (SparkMed). Further, it is resilient to failure, and able to use mobile and handheld devices to maintain its network, even in the absence of dedicated server devices. We have developed a prototype of the SparkMed framework for evaluation on a radiological workflow simulation, which uses SparkMed to deploy a radiological image viewer as an m-Health application for telemedical use by radiologists and stakeholders. We have evaluated our prototype using ten devices over WiFi and 3G, verifying that our framework meets its two main objectives: 1) interactive delivery of medical multimedia data to mobile devices; and 2) attaching to non-networked medical software processes without significantly impacting their performance. Consistent response times of under 500 ms and graphical frame rates of over 5 frames per second were observed under intended usage conditions. Further, overhead measurements displayed linear scalability and low resource requirements.},
