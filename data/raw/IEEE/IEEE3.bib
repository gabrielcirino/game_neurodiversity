  abstract={Converter-based generators are increasingly replacing classical synchronous generation, resulting in significant challenges to the operation and planning of modern power systems. Power electronics (PE)-based equipment, along with non-linear PE-driven loads, introduce time-varying characteristics and fast switching behavior that increases the complexity of the power system model. Faster control actions are needed to overcome the fast switching dynamics to ensure the reliability and stability of future power systems. Thus, this requires advanced and detailed simulation methods and tools with highly accurate equivalent models to embody the relatively slower electromechanical to faster electromagnetic transient (EMT) phenomena. Conventional transient stability analysis using positive-sequence simulators has become inadequate for representing converter-dominated power systems, while EMT simulators suffer from the high computational burden. This review paper presents accelerated EMT simulation methods and tools that are categorized and discussed in three topics: system equivalents, simulation methods, and accelerating tools. Dynamic system equivalent techniques are discussed to model small to large interconnected external systems of the grid network. Moreover, a systematic review is made for existing EMT simulation methods, along with advanced co-simulation methods, for addressing simulation speed and accuracy issues in large power system networks. Emerging hardware-based simulation tools are reviewed that reduce the computational burden and increase the simulation efficiency of the power system model. Challenges and trends in EMT simulation are also presented and concluded by providing perspectives on this research topic.},

  abstract={Plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging station service capability is physically limited by the charger availability and local transformer capacity. However, the station operation performance has become an increasingly important factor for enhancing charging service accessibility. In this work, we propose an innovative station-level optimization framework to operate charging station with optimal pricing policy and charge scheduling. This model incorporates human behaviors to explicitly and effectively capture drivers' charging decision process. We propose a menu of price-differentiated charging services, which differ in both the per-unit prices and the energy delivery schedule. Involving human in the loop, the operation model also exploits the capability to alleviate the overstay issue that occurs when a PEV's charging session has completed. We then propose a muli-block convex transformation methodology to reformulate the resulted non-convex problem via Fenchel-Young Inequality; the Block Coordinate Descent algorithm is applied to solve the overall problem and the efficiency enables real-time implementation. As a result, our simulation demonstrates that the proposed control polices can realize benefits in three aspects: (i) net profits gains, (ii) overstay reduction, and (iii) quality-of-service increase.},

  abstract={The exact and reliable understanding of driver behavior characteristics has a large potential contribution to the active safety control system, advanced driver assistance system, and intelligent traffic system. This study presents a driver behavior characteristics identification strategy based on bionic intelligent algorithms. First, a driver behavior data acquisition system is established to be used with test subjects of different driving skill levels for driving data acquisition. The preview optimal curvature model, which directly reflects the driver's behavior characteristics based on its parameters, is then chosen as the ideal driver behavior model and is identified through the genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and back propagation neural network. Moreover, this paper discusses the application of driver behavior characteristics identification in an integrated chassis control system (ICC), which integrates active front steering with electronic stability control. Finally, simulations are performed to verify the identification results and the application in the ICC by PanoSim and MATLAB/Simulink software. Based on the results, the proposed identification strategy precisely characterized the driver behavior. As a result, its application in the ICC improved the path-following ability and vehicle stability performance of the drivers.},

  abstract={Analyzing the feasibility of modifying setting values on the condition of the running line without exiting the protection function is of great importance for 110 kV substations. A system-level test of settings modification is proposed to verify that the values are correctly modified during the process and the protection function is still in effect. A cyber-physical automatic test bed using a real-time digital simulator (RTDS) is developed for relay protection to modify settings online, which distinctly improves work efficiency. Based on actual power grid parameters, a full-process closed-loop RTDS automatic control system is applied for performance testing when setting groups are changed. The experiments are focused on blocking time tests, setting groups switch and coverage tests, DC power supply intermittent tests, unwanted operations in setting value, changing load and protection starting tests, short-circuit fault tests and power system frequency oscillation tests. The results of the trial indicate that the automatic test bed is an effective technology for checking and verifying the reliability of modifying setting values online. In addition, 36 line protection devices from 12 relay protection manufacturers are tested. The reliability of each test item is analyzed and the relay performance is evaluated using a comprehensive method. The test bed provides reliable technical support for the design, engineering, commissioning and substation operation of online setting modification.},

  abstract={Inspired by the behavior law of human social groups, a new swarm intelligence algorithm named the dual-population social group optimization (DPSGO) algorithm is proposed in this article. Based on the primitive social group optimization (SGO) algorithm, dual-population grouping technology, reverse learning technology, immigration migration technology, and Gaussian mutation are introduced to further simulate the behavior law of actual human social groups. Experimental results and performance comparison show that the DPSGO algorithm has a better searchability and convergence rate. In addition, aiming at the socially hot issue of aviation safety, the simulation and experimental results show that the temperature measurement error can be reduced to less than 7.5 °C by using the DPSGO algorithm combined with reflected radiation correction to process the aeroengine multispectral radiation temperature measurement data. This article is of great significance to the design and optimization of swarm intelligence algorithms by using the behavior law of human social groups and provides valuable guidance for enhancing the safety monitoring of aeroengines.},

  pages={271-286},
  abstract={Abstract Classification algorithms are used in affective computing to classify the state of the user and adapt the computer's behaviour, but it is unclear how classification accuracy influences the overall user experience. We present a study in which classification accuracy is artificially pre-defined and used to adapt to the difficulty of a video game. Eighty subjects played the game and were told that difficulty would be adapted according to the measured brain activity. They played the game twice, with different classification accuracies, and then reported different aspects of their overall game experience using questionnaires. Classification accuracy was correlated with both in-game fun (r = 0.46) and satisfaction with the difficulty adaptation (r = 0.56). Most subjects could perceive a difference between two classification accuracies that differed by 16.7%. We tentatively posit that, for affective video games, an acceptable classification accuracy is 70–80%. Furthermore, studies that attempt to improve affect classification accuracy should aim for a practically meaningful improvement of 10%.},

  year={2013},

  pages={908-912},
  abstract={Screen-film-based radiography is being rapidly replaced by digital radiography (DR). Thin-film-transistors (TFT) with amorphous silicon (a-Si) or amorphous selenium (a-Se) are usually used in DR X-ray imaging systems. Another flat panel display, plasma display panel (PDP), has a structure that is similar to that of the conventional gas type radiation detectors, and can be manufactured with lower costs than the TFT-based detector panels. The motivation of this study was to develop a cost-effective DR detector using the PDP. In order to apply the PDP technologies in gaseous detectors for X-ray imaging, we modified the pixel's structure and optimized the materials inside the PDP panel. To maximize the signal's intensity, we re-designed the panel's structure based on the gas microstrip detector (GMD), and estimated the performance of the proposed detector using the Monte Carlo simulation method. Signal intensity of gaseous detector is determined by the amount of ionization as well as by the avalanche effect. The ionization and avalanche processes were simulated using the Geant4 and Garfield, respectively. Four types of gas mixtures and various values of electric fields have been explored. The results show that a higher proportion of Xe helps to generate more ionization electrons. The results also suggest that the electric field, which is applied between anode and cathode strips, is a dominant factor for the avalanche effect to occur. In this study, the GMD structure was adopted for the plasma-display-panel-based X-ray detector. A quantitative verification of the effectiveness of the proposed structure was performed as well.},

  title={The Effect of an Adaptive Simulated Inner Voice on User’s Eye-gaze Behaviour, Ownership Perception and Plausibility Judgement in Virtual Reality}, 
  year={2020},
  volume={32},
  number={1},
  pages={510-523},
  abstract={Virtual cognitions (VCs) are a stream of simulated thoughts people hear while emerged in a virtual environment, e.g. by hearing a simulated inner voice presented as a voice over. They can enhance people’s self-efficacy and knowledge about, for example, social interactions as previous studies have shown. Ownership and plausibility of these VCs are regarded as important for their effect, and enhancing both might, therefore, be beneficial. A potential strategy for achieving this is the synchronization of the VCs with people’s eye fixation using eye-tracking technology embedded in a head-mounted display. Hence, this paper tests this idea in the context of a pre-therapy for spider and snake phobia to examine the ability to guide people’s eye fixation. An experiment with 24 participants was conducted using a within-subjects design. Each participant was exposed to two conditions: one where the VCs were adapted to eye gaze of the participant and the other where they were not adapted, i.e. the control condition. The findings of a Bayesian analysis suggest that credibly more ownership was reported and more eye-gaze shift behaviour was observed in the eye-gaze-adapted condition than in the control condition. Compared to the alternative of no or negative mediation, the findings also give some more credibility to the hypothesis that ownership, at least partly, positively mediates the effect eye-gaze-adapted VCs have on eye-gaze shift behaviour. Only weak support was found for plausibility as a mediator. These findings help improve insight into how VCs affect people.},

  abstract={For the development of a traffic-simulation model to estimate the effect of adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems on traffic safety, throughput, and environment, data of a field operational test (FOT) were analyzed, in which vehicles were equipped with ACC and lane-departure warning (LDW) systems. The objective of this paper is to use this FOT to investigate the deactivation or (re)activation of the ACC on driver behavior in a real traffic environment. By taking these results into account in the traffic simulation environment, a more realistic evaluation of the impact of ACC on safety, throughput, and environment can be achieved. Some of the conclusions that were found are that after the participants deactivated the ACC by pressing the brake pedal, the gap with the lead vehicle was decreased. Resuming the ACC by activating the system or by releasing the throttle after overruling the system resulted in a larger gap between participant and lead vehicle than an overruled ACC or the ACC turned off. The participants overruled the ACC by pressing the throttle mainly to overtake the lead vehicle.},

  abstract={Neuronal variability has been thought to play an important role in the brain. As the variability mainly comes from the uncertainty in biophysical mechanisms, stochastic neuron models have been proposed for studying how neurons compute with noise. However, most papers are limited to simulating stochastic neurons in a digital computer. The speed and the efficiency are thus limited especially when a large neuronal network is of concern. This brief explores the feasibility of simulating the stochastic behavior of biological neurons in a very large scale integrated (VLSI) system, which implements a programmable and configurable Hodgkin-Huxley model. By simply injecting noise to the VLSI neuron, various stochastic behaviors observed in biological neurons are reproduced realistically in VLSI. The noise-induced variability is further shown to enhance the signal modulation of a neuron. These results point toward the development of analog VLSI systems for exploring the stochastic behaviors of biological neuronal networks in large scale.},

  abstract={This article presents the detailed thermal analysis and modeling of multichip power modules (PMs). For the first time, a fair thermal comparison between the widespread single-sided cooled (SSC) technology and the innovative double-sided cooled (DSC) one is presented. The latter solution emerges among all packaging techniques due to its improved electrical performances and mechanical reliability. The investigation is carried out using 3-D finite-element method thermal simulations automated by an in-house routine. The PMs under test are thoroughly studied in a wide range of boundary conditions (BCs) in order to support the choice of an appropriate cooling strategy and the comprehension of the heat spreading (HS) effect occurring in such domains. In addition, attention is paid to dynamic behavior. Thermal modeling strategies are then proposed and discussed. As the main finding, no relevant thermal discrepancies were observed in the two PM technologies. In most of the BCs, the SSC PM enjoys an enhanced HS effect leading to a better thermal behavior with respect to the DSC counterpart, the adoption of which is justified only in the presence of excellent cooling systems.},

A rich ontology defines various controllers, object behaviors, passive effects (physics), and collision effects. It can be used to quickly design games, without having to deal with control structures. We show how the dynamics of many classical games can be generated from a few lines of PyVGDL. Furthermore, the accompanying software library permits parsing and instantly playing those games, visualized from a bird's-eye or first-person viewpoint, and using them as benchmarks for learning algorithms.},

  abstract={Distributed interactive simulation (DIS) is a revolutionary development that is changing permanently many features of Defense Department work. The field of warfare modeling and simulation (M&S) is quite large, however, and this paper reviews its evolution and how DIS fits within it. A few things are clear. First, DIS is exceedingly valuable for training. Second, DIS could be a powerful means for improving the quality of planning and analysis if used wisely for occasional well designed experiments. These could 1) provide insights about real-world processes involving human performance and behavior (including decision making), 2) help inform and calibrate models, and 3) help test plans in a quasioperational environment. Third, distributed war gaming, which depends on DIS technology, is already lowering boundaries among developers, planners, and warfighters. This can shorten development processes and improve the results through virtual prototyping; it can also improve operational readiness. To achieve these potential benefits, however, will require a holistic approach, conceptual breakthroughs, and profoundly difficult model development efforts. The challenges include developing integrated hierarchies of models, developing adaptive decision models and other models of human behavior, developing and using new forms of uncertainty-sensitive analysis, and learning how to use DIS experiments effectively.<>},

  abstract={Evaluating ship encounters probability efficiently is significant for maritime transportation risk analysis as well as improving maritime traffic safety. In practice, ship encounters probability estimate by using traditional observation or field experiments is nearly impossible due to the expensive cost. In this paper, we propose a methodology framework for evaluating ship encounters probability based on an agent-based simulation paradigm. Individual ship’s navigation behavior is modeled as an agent, and their encounters are detected by an innovative geographic information system (GIS)-based intelligent algorithm. We then design and implement a prototype simulator based on the methodology framework and apply it in the mid-western waters of Bohai Sea of China to demonstrate its functionalities and utility. The findings show that the framework proposed in this paper has potential to provide decision support for guiding future marine transportation planning. This paper offers new insights and valuable demonstration on promoting maritime traffic safety management with the integration of GIS and emerging complex system simulation technology.},

First, the NSB method is analyzed, and the matrix theory is introduced to propose a behavior priority theory determination method based on a vector graph. Second, consider the maneuverability of the unmanned surface vehicle (USV), variable coefficients with physical significances are introduced to redefine the behavioral motion model, making the speed limit solved in each working condition within the maneuvering range of the USV and effectively improving the formation ability of MUSVs. Third, a logical priority collision avoidance strategy between the MUSVs is proposed, aiming at the problem that when the USVs judge each other as obstacles, both of them adopt the obstacle avoidance behavior resulting in two vehicles' courses deviating from the direction of the target point. Finally, a simulation platform for the formation control of MUSVs was established by taking the Dolphin-I prototype USV as the experimental object, and the feasibility of the proposed method was verified by a simulation test.},

  abstract={Successful cases of robot sales promotions have been increasing. Users tend to make purchases when robots properly interact with users. Most robot interactions/recommendations are created using specific products and locations within the context. Therefore, developers have to prepare a new recommendation interaction each time with each new product, which creates difficulty in responding smoothly to store’s requests. In this study, we propose Playful Recommendation, which is a situation-independent sales promotion method. This method stimulates pleasant emotions instead of presenting product information to the user, and the proposed method is less product-and location-dependent than other methods. Playful Recommendation was effective in two fieldworks. In both cases, the Playful Recommendation by the robot resulted in higher sales than the normal condition.

  year={2020},
  volume={30},
  number={4},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={This paper discusses the simulated and experimentally observed quench behavior of the first HL-LHC Twin Aperture Orbit Corrector Prototype, also known as the MCBRDp1 magnet. This superconducting magnet features two independently powered apertures. Each aperture comprises two concentric canted-cosine-theta-type Nb-Ti/Cu coils that together generate a dipolar magnetic field over the bore. These coils are held in place by conductive aluminum-alloy formers. The circuit is protected by a combination of energy extraction and quench-back in the coils. When the coils are discharged over an energy extractor, eddy currents are generated in the formers, and the resulting heat quickly and efficiently brings the Nb-Ti/Cu strands above their current sharing temperature, provided that the resistive voltage over the energy extractor is sufficiently large. This paper compares simulations and experimental observations. It is shown that with the BBQ tool, the initial voltage development after a training quench is correctly reproduced. The ProteCCT simulation tool is shown to be consistent with experimentally observed discharges of the MCBRDp1 prototype for different bath temperatures, energy extractor types, and initial operating currents. The baseline energy extractor resistor value of 1.5 Ω and the non-linear varistor option both give worst-case hotspot temperatures below the 200 K hotspot temperature limit. At ultimate current, the resulting hotspot temperatures are 143 and 167 K, and the peak voltages-to-ground are 590 and 440 V, respectively.},

  number={2},
  pages={170-179},
  abstract={The usage of each private electric vehicle (PrEV) is a repeating behavior process composed by driving, parking, discharging and charging, in which PrEV shows obvious procedural characteristics. To analyze the procedural characteristics, this paper proposes a procedural simulation method. The method aggregates the behavior process regularity of the PrEV cluster to model the cluster's charging load. Firstly, the basic behavior process of each PrEV is constructed by referring the statistical datasets of the traditional private non-electric vehicles. Secondly, all the basic processes are set as a simulation starting point, and they are dynamically reconstructed by several constraints. The simulation continues until the steady state of charge (SOC) distribution and behavior regularity of the PrEV cluster are obtained. Lastly, based on the obtained SOC and behavior regularity information, the PrEV cluster's behavior processes are simulated again to make the aggregating charging load model available. Examples for several scenarios show that the proposed method can improve the reliability of modeling by grasping the PrEV cluster's procedural characteristics.},

  abstract={Safe and effective evacuation is very important to reduce casualties after earthquakes. Given that evacuation is a checking process rather than a preselection process, evolutionary game theory can be used to better understand the crowd dynamics by analyzing the imitation effects in terms of individual interactions during evacuation. The key purpose of this paper was to construct an evolutionary game model of emergency evacuation of a teaching building at a university after an earthquake to search for the specific constraints necessary to reach the expected collective behaviors for orderly evacuation. We first analyzed the evacuation scenarios, including the environment of the teaching building, emergency degree of the earthquake and behaviors of the crowd. The related game players in the evacuation process were divided into three types, impulsive evacuees, calm evacuees and university staffs, and their payoff matrix was constructed according to the evacuation scenarios. Then, an evolutionary game model via the replicated dynamic system was created, and stable strategies were discussed. Next, we simulated eighteen evacuation scenarios with adjustment of the guiding authoritativeness, emergency degree, and group-oriented coefficient; the simulation results showed that the worst stable strategies can be avoided and the expected stable strategies can be obtained by adjusting the constraints, which are closely related to the corresponding management measures. Finally, the performance of the proposed model was verified by comparisons with the real videos and the conventional strategies.},

  year={2007},
  volume={24},
  number={1},
  pages={1-15},
  abstract={This paper studies two classes of epidemic models. These models are the standard SIR and SEIR models with time-varying periodic contact rate. The importance of the latent period is our target. When the latent period can be ignored and when it must be taken into account are the main points of our simulation. The comparison of the simulation results of our two models shows that the latent period is affecting the pattern of the dynamics of the disease. This paper addresses how model predictions are affected by the assumed form of the seasonally varying transmission rate and whether or not a latent class is included. Moreover, for some infectious diseases, using latent period leads to appearance or disappearance of some periodic solutions for the same parameter set. A key parameter for our models is the basic reproductive number R0 . We have simulated our models for a set of values of parameters insuring that R0 > 1, which represent the endemic case (Greenhalgh & Moneim, 2003; Moneim & Greenhalgh, 2005a,b). Different patterns have been obtained for each of the SIR or SEIR; these patterns are representing the filtered results of the long-term behaviour of the endemic periodic solution for a range of amplitude parameter values of the periodic contact rate. So it is too important to determine which type of model SIR or SEIR is more likely to describe the actual nature of the dynamics of each disease.},

Analysis of the evolved behaviours and their network-internal mechanisms reveals a behavioural structure and organization resembling a Brooksian subsumption architecture. The task decomposition, as well as the resulting individual behaviours and their integration, however, are realized as network-internal state space dynamics, evolved in the course of agent-environment interaction, i.e. with a minimum of designer intervention.},

  year={2024},
  volume={21},
  number={3},
  pages={2648-2656},
  abstract={The safety and dynamic stability of the two-wheeled self-balancing personal mobility (SBPM) are critical for their operation, and hence these issues need to be evaluated objectively. But due to the nature of the SBPM, they must be operated by the human rider even for the evaluation tests, so the objectivity and repeatability of the test cannot be ensured, and there even could be the safety issue for the test rider. To solve this problem, we propose an anthropomorphic test dummy robot (ATDR) that reproduces the human rider’s dynamic behavior using the control moment gyroscope (CMG) so that it could drive the SBPM instead of a human rider for the tests. As the human rider controls the SBPM by the disturbance torque made by the posture (i.e. the center of gravity) change, CMG-based ATDR reproduces the dynamic behavior of the SBPM by creating the same disturbance torque using the CMG. Design and manufacturing details of the CMG-based ATDR are introduced, and the control algorithm ensuring that CMG-based ATDR reproduces the same behavior as the human rider is explained. For the validation of the proposed CMG-based ATDR, manufactured CMG-based ATDR was controlled to drive the SBPM in the most common driving scenarios such as acceleration/deceleration ride and turning motion, and its dynamic response data was compared with that obtained from the human rider case. Note to Practitioners—This paper was motivated by the objectivity issue of the safety certification tests for the SBPM. Existing approaches to the safety certification process requires tests run by human operators, which essentially leads to the question of objectivity in the test results. This paper suggests a new approach using an ATDR that mimics the human operator’s motion intent and eliminates the need of the human operator. In this paper, we present the working principle how ATDR regenerates the human operator’s motion and the detailed design of the ATDR to implement this goal. We then show the control algorithm designed to drive the SBPM as if it was driven by a human operator using the ATDR. Experiments carried out for the major hazardous driving scenarios required for the safety certification suggest that the ATDR could be used as a viable device for the objective safety certification process of the SBPM. In future research, we will expand the application of the ATDR for different types of SBPMs.},

  volume={8},

  pages={193523-193531},
  abstract={In Pakistan most of the local hospitals have limited resources and budget deficits to address day-to-day routine activities. This is further intensified by inefficient management of hospital resources. Hence, it is essential to efficiently manage hospital resource as it will lead to health care costs reduction and increased patient’s satisfaction. The focus of this research is to demonstrate the use of the tool in healthcare system, specifically in Pakistan, and balance the resources of a hospital, which will reduce the waiting time for the Outdoor Patients Departments. The resources at the Outdoor Patients Department including X-ray, Labs, Ultrasound and the ECG sections were included in the computer-based simulation model with the aim to find the bottleneck departments as they are the main cause of waiting time in the hospital. These bottlenecks are anticipated due to the lack of an optimized model, which has been addressed in this simulation. Based on the simulation study an optimized model is proposed to the hospital administration where the resources are readjusted resulting in the utilization of underutilized departments and decreasing the waiting time of the stations particularly the bottleneck stations. The motivation behind this research is to aid hospitals in better management of resources, which can ultimately improve customers (patients) satisfaction.},

Our research examines genetic programming (GP) as a technique to automatically develop effective squad behaviors for shooter games. GP has been used to evolve teams capable of defeating a single powerful enemy agent in a number of environments without the use of any explicit team communication. This paper is an extension of our paper presented at the 2008 Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment (AIIDE'08). Its aim is to explore the effects of shared perception on the evolution of effective squad behaviors. Thus, NPCs are given the ability to explicitly communicate their perceived information during evolution. The results show that the explicit communication of perceived information between team members enables an improvement in average team effectiveness. },

  abstract={Large multiscale neuronal network simulations are of increasing value as more big data are gathered about brain wiring and organization under the auspices of a current major research initiative, such as Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies. The development of these models requires new simulation technologies. We describe here the current use of the NEURON simulator with message passing interface (MPI) for simulation in the domain of moderately large networks on commonly available high-performance computers (HPCs). We discuss the basic layout of such simulations, including the methods of simulation setup, the run-time spike-passing paradigm, and postsimulation data storage and data management approaches. Using the Neuroscience Gateway, a portal for computational neuroscience that provides access to large HPCs, we benchmark simulations of neuronal networks of different sizes (500–100,000 cells), and using different numbers of nodes (1–256). We compare three types of networks, composed of either Izhikevich integrate-and-fire neurons (I&F), single-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) cells, or a hybrid network with half of each. Results show simulation run time increased approximately linearly with network size and decreased almost linearly with the number of nodes. Networks with I&F neurons were faster than HH networks, although differences were small since all tested cells were point neurons with a single compartment.},

  abstract={As eusocial creatures, bees display unique macro collective behavior and local body dynamics that hold potential applications in various fields, such as computer animation, robotics, and social behavior. Unlike birds and fish, bees fly in a low-aligned zigzag pattern. Additionally, bees rely on visual signals for foraging and predator avoidance, exhibiting distinctive local body oscillations, such as body lifting, thrusting, and swaying. These inherent features pose significant challenges to realistic bee simulations in practical animation applications. In this article, we present a bio-inspired model for bee simulations capable of replicating both macro collective behavior and local body dynamics of bees. Our approach utilizes a visually-driven system to simulate a bee's local body dynamics, incorporating obstacle perception and body rolling control for effective collision avoidance. Moreover, we develop an oscillation rule that captures the dynamics of the bee's local bodies, drawing on insights from biological research. Our model extends beyond simulating individual bees’ dynamics; it can also represent bee swarms by integrating a fluid-based field with the bees’ innate noise and zigzag motions. To fine-tune our model, we utilize pre-collected honeybee flight data. Through extensive simulations and comparative experiments, we demonstrate that our model can efficiently generate realistic low-aligned and inherently noisy bee swarms.},

Since very little is known about the nervous system of the animal, the model is mainly based on behavioural data and the sensitivities of its photoreceptors. The model consists of a number of interacting behaviour systems that are triggered by specific stimuli and control specific behaviours. The ability of the moth to learn the colours of different flowers and the adaptive processes involved in the choice between stimulus-approach and place-approach strategies is also modelled. The behavioural choices of the simulated model closely parallel those of the real animal. The model has implications both for the ecology of the animal and for robotic systems},

  abstract={Microscopic traffic-simulation tools are increasingly being applied to evaluate the impacts of a wide variety of intelligent transport systems (ITS) applications and other dynamic problems that are difficult to solve using traditional analytical models. The accuracy of a traffic-simulation system depends highly on the quality of the traffic-flow model at its core, with the two main critical components being the car-following and lane-changing models. This paper presents findings from a comparative evaluation of car-following behavior in a number of traffic simulators [advanced interactive microscopic simulator for urban and nonurban networks (AIMSUN), parallel microscopic simulation (PARAMICS), and Verkehr in Stadten-simulation (VISSIM)]. The car-following algorithms used in these simulators have been developed from a variety of theoretical backgrounds and are reported to have been calibrated on a number of different data sets. Very few independent studies have attempted to evaluate the performance of the underlying algorithms based on the same data set. The results reported in this study are based on a car-following experiment that used instrumented vehicles to record the speed and relative distance between follower and leader vehicles on a one-lane road. The experiment was replicated in each tool and the simulated car-following behavior was compared to the field data using a number of error tests. The results showed lower error values for the Gipps-based models implemented in AIMSUN and similar error values for the psychophysical spacing models used in VISSIM and PARAMICS. A qualitative "drift and goal-seeking behavior" test, which essentially shows how the distance headway between leader and follower vehicles should oscillate around a stable distance, also confirmed the findings.},

Thus, the arc-splitting process with ferromagnetic plates can be included. Arc motion is described in detail by the temperature distribution. Some interesting phenomena are observed in the simulation, such as the arc root jumping from contact to arc runner, the arc back commutation before splitting into series arcs by metallic plates, new arc root formation in splitting process, and, finally, the arc go across the splitter plates in the chamber. Moreover, the simulation result is compared with experimental result, which shows good agreement.},

  abstract={Here, we introduce the design and preliminary validation of a general-purpose architecture for affectivedriven procedural content generation in virtual reality (VR) applications in mental health and wellbeing. The architecture supports seven commercial physiological sensing technologies and can be deployed in immersive and nonimmersive VR systems. To demonstrate the concept, we developed the “The Emotional Labyrinth,” a non-linear scenario in which navigation in a procedurally generated three-dimensional maze is entirely decided by the user, and whose features are dynamically adapted according to a set of emotional states. During navigation, affective states are dynamically represented through pictures, music, and animated visual metaphors chosen to represent and induce affective states. The underlying hypothesis is that exposing users to multimodal representations of their affective states can create a feedback loop that supports emotional self-awareness and fosters more effective emotional regulation strategies. We carried out a first study to, first, assess the effectiveness of the selected metaphors in inducing target emotions, and second, identify relevant psycho-physiological markers of the emotional experience generated by the labyrinth. Results show that the Emotional Labyrinth is overall a pleasant experience in which the proposed procedural content generation can induce distinctive psychophysiological patterns, generally coherent with the meaning.},

  abstract={Accurate modeling of soft- and hard-magnetic materials for the numerical simulation of rotating electrical machines is required to allow predictions on the operational characteristics along the torque-speed map, already in the design stage. The full potential of most appropriate material selection and concurrent geometry adaption can only be utilized if models can represent actual material behavior. The accurate prediction of iron losses of soft-magnetic materials for various frequencies and magnetic flux densities, as well as the degradation due to manufacturing is eminent for the design of electrical machines. Therefore, advanced material models need to be adapted and their accuracy examined to further improve the modeling and enable progression. This paper will give an overview of the current modeling approaches applied at the Institute of Electrical Machines for soft- and hard-magnetic materials in the simulation of rotating electrical machines. A case example in the form of a traction drive is presented to which the models are applied. For the machine modeling, the inhouse solver pyMOOSE is utilized. In order to determine the losses with regard to manufacturing processes, the iron-loss model with material degradation is used in combination with a machine simulation scheme of the entire operating range of the machine. Here, various simulation approaches are combined to form the entire computational toolchain to obtain accurate results in the entire operational range.},

  abstract={The assessment of knowledge and learning progress in the context of game-based learning requires novel, noninvasive, and embedded approaches. In the present paper, we introduce a mathematical framework which relates the (problem solution) behavior of a learner in the game context to the learner's available and lacking competencies. We argue that a problem situation and its status at a certain point in time can be described by a set of game props and their current properties or states. In the course of the game, the learner can perform different actions to modify the props and, consequently, change the problem situation. Each action is evaluated with respect to its correctness or appropriateness for accomplishing a given task which, in turn, enables conclusions about the competence state of the learner. This assessment procedure serves as the basis for adaptive interventions, for instance, by providing the learner with guidance or feedback.},

  abstract={Mathematical and simulation models enable hydroelectric power unit dynamic behavior analysis using computers. To approximate the power unit dynamics as accurate as possible, nonlinear high-order model is required. This paper describes a hydroelectric power unit with double regulated Kaplan turbine. The runners of such turbines permit the blades angle to be varied on the run depending on operating conditions. This ensures maximum turbine efficiency under all operating conditions. Detailed mathematical and digital simulation model of the hydroelectric power unit with double regulated turbine was presented for turbine control system analysis.

  pages={235-246},
  abstract={Based on some new accelerated lifetime models and failure equivalent circuit modeling techniques for the common semiconductor wear out mechanisms, simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis (SPICE) can be used to characterize CMOS VLSI circuit failure behaviors and perform reliability simulation. This paper used a simple SRAM circuit as an example to demonstrate how to apply SPICE to circuit reliability modeling, simulation, analysis, and design. The SRAM circuit, implemented with a commercial 0.25-mum technology, consists of functional blocks of 1-bit six-transistor cell, precharge, read/write control, and sense amplifier. The SRAM operation sequence of "write 0, read 0, write 1, read 1" was first simulated in SPICE to obtain the terminal voltage and current stress profiles of each transistor. Then, normalized lifetimes of all transistors in terms of each failure mechanism were calculated with the corresponding accelerated lifetime models. These lifetime values were sorted to single out the most damaged transistors. Finally, the selected transistors were substituted with failure equivalent circuit models, and SPICE simulations were performed again to characterize the circuit performance, functionality, and failure behaviors. The simulation shows that the 0.25-mum technology, hot-carrier injection (HCI), and time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) had significant effects on SRAM-cell stability and voltage-transfer characteristics, while negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) mainly degraded the cell transition speed when the cell state flipped. This illustrative SRAM simulation work proves that, with SPICE and the failure equivalent circuit models, circuit designers can better understand the damage effects of HCI/TDDB/NBTI on the circuit operation, quickly estimate the circuit lifetime, make appropriate performance/reliability tradeoffs, and formulate practical design guidelines to improve the circuit reliability},

  abstract={Automated driving systems need to perform according to what human drivers expect in every situation. A different behavior can be wrongly interpreted by other human drivers and cause traffic problems, disturbances to other road participants, or in the worst case, an accident. In this paper, we propose a behavior cloning concept for learning high-level decisions from recorded trajectories of real traffic. We summarized and gave a clear definition of the main features that affect how humans make driving decisions. Some other approaches rely on complex neural networks where their decisions are impossible to understand. Due to the importance of the decision making module, we produce safe human-like behavior which is transparent to humans and easy to track. Furthermore, the learned policy is not overfitting to the limited training data and generalizes well to multi-lane scenarios with arbitrary speed limits and traffic density, which is strengthened by the successful application of merging policy on exiting. Simulation evaluations show that our learned policy is able to handle the intention uncertainty of surrounding agents, and provide human-like decisions in the sense of well-balanced behavior between efficiency, comfort, perceived safety, and politeness.},

  abstract={Traditionally, many American technical communicators have tended to view translation as a "one-way" system in which they create English-language source text that is converted into another language. This singular perspective of translation can be seen in professional communication literature that tends to focus on how to better "write for translation" rather than exploring other ways in which technical communicators might be able to make use of translators or the translation process. While English is a key language used in international technical and scientific discourse, it is not the only language being used. Speakers of languages other than English are increasingly contributing to various scientific and technical fields. As a result of this factor, technical communicators should begin rethinking ways in which they view and use translation if they wish to remain effective communicators in the new global marketplace.},

  abstract={Microwave structure behavior prediction is an important research topic in radio frequency (RF) design. In recent years, deep-learning-based techniques have been widely implemented to study microwaves, and they are envisaged to revolutionize this arduous and time-consuming work. However, empirical data collection and neural network training are two significant challenges of applying deep learning techniques to practical RF modeling and design problems. To this end, this letter investigates a transfer-learning-based approach to improve the accuracy and efficiency of predicting microwave structure behaviors. Through experimental comparisons, we validate that the proposed approach can reduce the amount of data required for training while shortening the neural network training time for the behavior prediction of microwave structures.},

  abstract={Recent decline in active transport and increase in motorized transport decreases physical activity and increases air pollution. Using games to motivate people to change their behavior toward active transport can mitigate this. We proposed Tic-Tac-Training, a distributed, collaborative, and competitive game for promoting active transport at workplaces. Tic-Tac-Training was developed through a multidisciplinary and iterative user-centered design (UCD) process in four stages: 1) paper prototype, 2) low-fidelity prototypes, 3) high-fidelity prototypes, and 4) digital prototype. User testing and playtesting (N = 12) yielded a number of improvement suggestions. We also analyzed how Tic-Tac-Training supports the eight core drives of gamification (Octalysis), and presented 17 lessons learned in four categories. Findings suggest that UCD can be useful for developing exergame interventions for workplaces. Moreover, the lessons learned can benefit exergame designers. More research is needed to measure the behavior change effect of Tic-Tac-Training and its applicability to other use cases.},

  abstract={This paper presents the current behavior and axial Lorenz force of stacked no-insulation (NI) REBa2Cu3O7-x (REBCO, RE = Rare Earth) double-pancake coils during local normal-state transition. The NI winding technique enhances the thermal stability and increases the engineering current density in REBCO pancake coils. The high thermal stability of NI REBCO coil has been verified in experiments of overcurrent test. In addition, the numerical simulations of NI REBCO single-pancake coils have been performed to confirm the high stability. However, REBCO magnets usually consist of some stacked double-pancake coils to generate a high magnetic field for practical applications. When a normal-state transition occurs in one of the stacked pancake coils, it may affect the other pancake coils. For the more reliable verification, the current and electromagnetic force behavior of stacked NI REBCO pancake coils during a normal-state transition should be simulated. To examine the stacked NI REBCO pancake coils, we extend the previously proposed partial element equivalent circuit (PEEC) model to deal with a few double-pancake coils. In this paper, an NI REBCO double-pancake coil and their three stacked coils are simulated by using the extended PEEC model.},

  pages={11316-11327},
  abstract={The simple rules that govern the interactions between the different components of a complex system often lead to interesting behaviours that are unexpected. The experiments described in this paper involved creating a variation of a traditional Braitenberg Vehicle, by placing sensors on ten different possible locations on a simulated vehicle, and incorporating an obstacle avoidance behaviour using a subsumption-like architecture, which resulted in different unusual and unexpected behaviours being produced. The vehicle was allowed to explore a simulated environment which contained a single bright light in the centre with walls on the border. By using a novel combination of the Prediction by Partial Matching compression algorithm and k-means clustering, interesting emergent behaviours were effectively discovered within a search space of over 10,000 simulations produced from a simple interaction of light and proximity sensors on a vehicle and a single light source. The clustering algorithm discovered five distinct behaviours: circling and spiralling behaviours; interesting behaviours creating intricate rose petal-like structures; behaviours that create simple rose petal-like structures; behaviours with large movements and low complexity; and behaviours with less movement. The novel algorithm demonstrated in this paper has useful potential in the science of complex systems and modelling to help expedite the systematic exploration of a substantial search space of simulations in order to discover interesting behaviours.},

  abstract={Crowd simulation addresses algorithmic approaches to steering, navigation, perception, and behavioral models. Significant progress has been achieved in modeling interactions between agents and the environment to avoid collisions, exploit empirical local decision data, and plan efficient paths to goals. We address a relatively unexplored dimension of virtual human behavior: thermal perception, comfort, and appropriate behavioral responses. Thermal comfort is associated with the ambient environment, agent density factors, and interpersonal thermal feedback. A key feature of our approach is the temporal integration of both thermal exposure and occupant density to directly influence agent movements and behaviors (e.g., clothing changes) to increase thermal comfort. Empirical thermal comfort models are incorporated as a validation basis. Simple heat transfer models are used to model environment, agent, and interpersonal heat exchange. Our model’s generality makes it applicable to any existing crowd steering algorithm as it adds additional integrative terms to any cost function. Examples illustrate distinctive emergent behaviors such as balancing agent density with thermal comfort, hysteresis in responding to localized or brief thermal events, and discomfort and likely injury produced by extreme packing densities.},

  abstract={This paper presents a detailed analysis of short-circuit current behavior during interturn short-circuit faults in permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs) by considering the short-circuit contact resistance. For this purpose, an finite element analysis (FEA)-based equivalent circuit model is developed to understand the circulating current behavior in the shorted turns. Various fault resistance and number of shorted turn combinations are examined at different torque and speed levels. To include saturation due to high fault currents, the inductance matrix of faulty machine is created in FEA environment and incorporated into the equivalent circuit model as four-dimensional lookup tables. In order to take loop responses into account, the model is controlled through field oriented control (FOC) with closed speed and current loops. An experimental setup is built to verify the simulation results using a PMSM with several winding taps. It is shown that the experimental results and the simulations are quite consistent with each other. The findings from this study are essential to predict fault severity, develop mitigation techniques and determine the safe operating area for faulty machines.},

  abstract={The amount of experimental data concerning physiology and anatomy of the nervous system is growing very fast, challenging our capacity to make comprehensive syntheses of the plethora of data available. Computer models of neuronal networks provide useful tools to construct such syntheses. They can be used to interpret experimental data, generate experimentally testable predictions, and formulate new hypotheses regarding the function of the neural systems. Models can also act as a bridge between different levels of neuronal organization. The ultimate aim of computational neuroscience is to provide a link between behavior and underlying neural mechanisms. Depending on the specific aim of the model, there are different levels of neuronal organization at which the model can be set. Models are constructed at the microscopic (molecular and cellular), macroscopic level (local populations or systems), or dynamical systems level. Apart from purely computational models, hybrid networks are being developed in which biological neurons are connected in vitro to computer simulated neurons. Also, neuromorphic systems are recently being created using silicon chips that mimic computational operations in the brain. This paper reviews various computational models of the brain and insights obtained through their simulations.},

  year={2019},
  volume={6},

  pages={377-386},
  abstract={In this paper, we present a novel crowd behavior evolution method with emotional contagion in political rallies. We first analyze the most representative political rally scenes in detail and model them into two kinds of abstract scenario. Furthermore, the “extroversion” and “empathy” factors from the OCEAN model are chosen to describe the most important individual personalities in such scenarios. Based on this, an improved emotional contagion model is proposed by combining the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model and individual personality under different political viewpoints. Finally, the crowd in a political rally is driven to move according to the new potential moving direction generated by emotional contagion and the original direction of the individual together. The experiments show that our method can intuitively demonstrate the emotional changes of those individuals with different political perspectives and reasonably simulate the crowd movement under the political rally scenes.},

  abstract={Microscopic modeling of driving behavior is the basis for traffic design and traffic simulation studies and can be applied to automated driving systems to provide human-like decision making. Previous modeling methods can be mainly divided into scenario-based modeling methods and field theory-based modeling methods. Scenario-based models are based on behavior theories that can explain behavioral mechanisms and field theory-based models are convenient for application to different scenarios. Combining two behavior theories and field theory, this paper aims to present a novel method to uniformly model the driving behavior in different scenarios. Risk homeostasis theory and preview-follower theory are used as the theoretical foundation, and field theory is utilized to connect the two behavior theories. A new risk field model is constructed for better coupling these behavior theories. Integrating these theories, this study then develops a subjectively perceived risk quantification method and a trajectory and motion planning model, which are validated using naturalistic data in car-following scenarios. Results show the effectiveness of this method and this model with reference to an effective risk quantification index (safety margin) and in comparison with the classical models (desired safety margin model and intelligent driver model) using naturalistic data in car-following scenarios.},

  title={Toward a Digital Twin for Arthroscopic Knee Surgery: A Systematic Review}, 
  year={2022},

  pages={45029-45052},
  abstract={The use of digital twins to represent a product or process digitally is trending in many engineering disciplines. This term has also been recently introduced in the medical field. In arthroscopic surgery education, the paradigm shift from apprenticeship to simulation training has driven the need for better simulators, and the current focus is on improving simulators with respect to computational efficiency and system accuracy. However, expanding surgical simulations towards digital twins has not yet been explored. This paper introduces the digital twin concept for arthroscopic surgery, and explores its potential in light of the existing scientific literature. Thus, a systematic review was conducted to summarize and analyze the literature with respect to fast and robust design of an arthroscopic digital twin using patient-specific information, and methods for interactive surgical soft tissue simulation. The review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol with three reliable scientific search engines: IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect and PubMed. Eighty papers were included in the review, and the extracted data included modeling methods, tissue types, constitutive behavior, computational efficiency or accuracy, hardware configuration, haptic device description, software tools, and system architectures. Considering the review, a novel macro-level conceptual arthroscopic digital twin system is presented, and the applicability of the review findings for the identified subsystems are discussed. The proposed system integrates patient-specific images, diagnostic data, intraoperative sensor data, and surgical practice as inputs, and conceptually enables surgical skills training, preoperative planning, and a database of virtual surgeries.},

  abstract={The road traffic safety situation is severe worldwide and exploring driving behavior is a research hotspot since it is the main factor causing road accidents. However, there are few studies investigating how to evaluate real-time traffic safety of driving behavior and the number of driving behavior safety levels has not yet been thoroughly explored. This paper aims to propose a framework of real-time driving behavior safety level classification and evaluation, which was validated by a case study of driving simulation experiments. The proposed methodology focuses on determining the optimal aggregation time interval, finding the optimal number of safety levels for driving behavior, classifying the safety levels, and evaluating the driving safety levels in real time. An improved cross-validation mean square error model based on driver behavior vectors was proposed to determine the optimal aggregation time interval, which was found to be 1s. Three clustering techniques were applied, i.e., k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering and model-based clustering. The optimal number of clusters was found to be three. Support vector machines, decision trees and naïve Bayes classifiers were then developed as classification models. The accuracy of the combination of k-means clustering and decision trees proved to be the best with three clusters.},

  abstract={Several decades of development in the fields of robotics and automation have resulted in human-robot interaction is commonplace, and the subject of intense study. These interactions are particularly prevalent in manufacturing, where human operators (HOs) have been employed in numerous robotics and automation tasks. The presence of HOs continues to be a source of uncertainty in such systems, despite the study of human factors, in an attempt to better understand these variations in performance. Concurrent developments in intelligent manufacturing present opportunities for adaptability within robotic control. This article examines relevant human factors and develops a framework for integrating the necessary elements of intelligent control and data processing to provide appropriate adaptability to robotic elements, consequently improving collaborative interaction with human colleagues. A neural network-based learning approach is used to predict the influence on human task performance and use these predictions to make informed changes to programed behavior, and a methodology developed to explore the application of learning techniques to this area further. This article is supported by an example case study, in which a simulation model is used to explore the application of the developed system, and its performance in a real-world production scenario. The simulation results reveal that adaptability can be realized with some relatively simple techniques and models if applied in the right manner and that such adaptability is helpful to tackle the issue of performance disparity in manufacturing operations. Note to Practitioners-This article presents research into the application of intelligent methodologies to this problem and builds a framework to describe how this information can be captured, generated, and used within manufacturing production processes. This framework helps identify which areas require further research and serves as a basis for the development of a methodology, by which a control system may enable adaptable behavior to reduce the impact of human performance variation and improve human-machine interaction (HMI). This article also presents a simulation-based case study to support the development and evaluate the presented control system on a representative real-world problem. The methodology makes use of a machine-learning approach to identify the complex influence of several identified human factors on human performance. This knowledge can be used to adjust the robotic behavior to match the predicted performance of multiple different operators over different scenarios. This adaptability reduces performance disparity by reducing idle times and enabling leaner production through workpiece-in-progress reduction. Future work will focus on expanding the intelligent capabilities of the proposed system to deal with uncertainty and improve decision-making ability.},

  abstract={This letter presents a novel approach for evaluating the mean behavior of the well known normalized least mean squares (NLMS) adaptive algorithm for a circularly correlated Gaussian input. The mean analysis of the NLMS algorithm requires the calculation of some normalized moments of the input. This is done by first expressing these moments in terms of ratios of quadratic forms of spherically symmetric random variables and finding the cumulative density function (CDF) of these variables. The CDF is then used to calculate the required moments. As a result, we obtain explicit expressions for the mean behavior of the NLMS algorithm.},

To understand their electrical and thermal behavior, we rely on concepts and techniques from radio-frequency circuit simulation and introduce the periodic steady state and perform periodic ac analysis. We also construct TES device models based on a comprehensive two-fluid physical model and investigate the behavior of ac-biased TES circuits using advanced circuit simulators. By relating our findings to results for the analysis of dc-biased TES circuits, we give appropriate definitions for the current and temperature sensitivity of the TES in ac-biased circuits. Our work not only builds a rigorous foundation for theoretical analysis of ac-biased TES circuits but also introduces powerful simulation techniques valuable for their design and research.},

  abstract={Currently, social networks and Internet access have become a place that fosters risky experiences for their users, who are vulnerable and can become victims of violence, online abuse, extortion, etc. Therefore, it is considered necessary to make people aware of the appropriate use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and Internet access, to minimize the risks and vulnerabilities associated with these practices. This research analyzes the use of a game-like mobile application called CiberSecApp, which was designed to support the teaching of basic cybersecurity. This application was designed as a game because gamification has been shown to generate motivation and keep users interested in long periods of time. In addition, the new generation of students perceives educational mobile apps as an innovative way to access educational content in a simple, ubiquitous, and portable way Unlike other similar initiatives in the existing literature, this research did not focus solely on the game design aspects, but also on evaluating the user experience. For this purpose, the IBM Computer Usability Satisfaction Questionnaires (CSUQ) and the NASA Task Load Index (TLX) were used to evaluate the usability of the mobile application and the mental workload generated by the participants. A total of 60 engineering students participated voluntarily in this research. The results obtained show that the use of gamification of educational content can support the teaching of cybersecurity by creating an intention of use and with a low mental workload for its users.},

  volume={16},

  pages={903-913},
  abstract={The balancing process for game levels in competitive two-player contexts involves a lot of manual work and testing, particularly for nonsymmetrical game levels. In this work, we frame game balancing as a procedural content generation task and propose an architecture for automatically balancing of tile-based levels within the procedural content generation via reinforcement learning framework (PCGRL) framework. Our architecture is divided into three parts: first, a level generator, second, a balancing agent, and third, a reward modeling simulation. Through repeated simulations, the balancing agent receives rewards for adjusting the level toward a given balancing objective, such as equal win rates for all players. To this end, we propose new swap-based representations to improve the robustness of playability, thereby enabling agents to balance game levels more effectively and quickly compared to traditional PCGRL. By analyzing the agent's swapping behavior, we can infer which tile types have the most impact on the balance. We validate our approach in the neural massively multiplayer online environment in a competitive two-player scenario. In this article, we present improved results, explore the applicability of the method to various forms of balancing beyond equal balancing, compare the performance to another search-based approach, and discuss the application of existing fairness metrics to game balancing.},

  abstract={Sensorimotor impairment is a prevalent condition requiring effective rehabilitation strategies. This study introduces a novel wearable device for Mindful Sensorimotor Training (MiSMT) designed for sensory and motor rehabilitation. Our MiSMT device combines motor training using myoelectric pattern recognition along sensory training using two tactile displays. This device offers a comprehensive solution, integrating electromyography and haptic feedback, lacking in existing devices. The device features eight electromyography channels, a rechargeable battery, and wireless Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connectivity for seamless communication with a computer or mobile device. Its flexible material allows for adaptability to various body parts, ensuring ease of use in diverse patients. The two tactile displays, with 16 electromagnetic actuators each, provide touch and vibration sensations up to 250 Hz. In this proof-of-concept study, we show improved two-point discrimination after 5 training sessions in participants with intact limbs (p=0.047). We also demonstrated successful acquisition, processing, and decoding of myoelectric signals in offline and online evaluations. In conclusion, the MiSMT device presents a promising tool for sensorimotor rehabilitation by combining motor execution and sensory training benefits. Further studies are required to assess its effectiveness in individuals with sensorimotor impairments. Integrating mindful sensory and motor training with innovative technology can enhance rehabilitation outcomes and improve the quality of life for those with sensorimotor impairments.},

  year={2024},
  volume={11},

  pages={5685-5698},
  abstract={Indoor human mobility plays a crucial role in the transmission of respiratory infectious diseases. Previous studies have predominantly addressed a single type or a series of behaviors in specific scenarios, neglecting the abstraction of mobility behavior in various scenes and how these abstracted behaviors impact disease propagation. To address these problems, this study abstracts mobility behaviors in a general scenario into two main categories: crowding behavior from the spatial aspect (i.e., a group of people gathering closely), and stopping behavior from the temporal aspect (i.e., someone remaining in one position without any change over time). Then, their impacts on disease spreading and the impact of individual spatiotemporal distribution resulting from these behaviors on epidemic transmission are investigated. First, behavioral factors and transmission trend indicators are defined, and the exposure risk with virion-laden particles (ERP) model is used as the fundamental for simulation. Second, 200 indoor scenarios are constructed and simulated to help determine variable values. Concurrently, the influences of target factors on disease transmission are determined using structural equation modeling and causal inference modeling. Final, guidelines are formulated to mitigate epidemic spread in indoor scenarios: prioritizing “increasing the number of point of interests (POIs) for a fixed number of people” compared to “making the distribution of POIs more dispersed” and “limiting the number of stoppings,” and ultimately using “shortening the duration of stopping” strategy; “directing the distribution of individuals more uniform” by implementing the aforementioned strategies or be conducted independently.},

  abstract={To further our understanding of mechanisms that exhibit life-like behavior, attention should be given to the emergent dynamics by which a new action or agent, as the representation of that action, is brought forth. The problem is how to model the intuitive notion of the emergence of an action, without involving arbitrariness in the modeling process. In considering how to implement such a notion onto a computer, it could be interpreted as the generation of a new algorithm, or the generation of a new code establishing a mapping between a symbol and an information. This paper proposes an ecological model, named PROTEAN, consisting of Turing machines as a platform on which to simulate the emergent dynamics of computational procedures. Although the system is not provided with any particular mechanism for self-reproduction, the constituents of the ecosystem adapt themselves to improve their utilization of the environment for survival. This paper demonstrates and discusses how adaptive behaviors of algorithms may be achieved with PROTEAN through computer simulations.},

  abstract={During the Coronavirus pandemic, e-learning systems have proven to be an essential pillar for education. This raises to surface what many studies have addressed earlier; creating a platform that completes the traditional classroom work and maximizes the effectiveness of learning outcomes. Striving to achieve such platform, studies have considered gamifying and personalizing the educational resources for the adaptation of educational systems as per the intended learners through intensive learning analytics. But was the learner really a part of the adaptation process taking place? Learning analytics are usually designed to the course’s adaptation and solely for the teachers. Thus, learning analytics in gamified adaptive educational systems involving the course, teachers and learners together are still under investigation. In this study, the Personalized Adaptive Gamified E-learning (PAGE) model is introduced to extend MOOCs by providing new satisfactory levels of learning analytics and visualization in the rich e-learning process that supports the learner’s intervention in the resultant learning analytics. The proposed Learning analytics have been developed to make the necessary adaptation to the course and learner’s learning flow, as well as visualizing the process and adaptation decisions to the learners. Results show a positive potential towards learning adaptation and visualization, and a necessity to provide an additional focus for the gamification concept.},

The present version of RAMSAS is the result of an intensive experimentation phase in several application domains (avionics, automotive, and satellite) that allowed for the improvement of the effectiveness of the method, particularly in the modeling of both the intended and dysfunctional system behaviors. Moreover, this paper discusses the specific issues that arise when moving from the reliability analysis of systems to that of systems of systems (SoSs) and proposes a possible extension of the RAMSAS method (called RAMSoS) that is able to address the identified issues and thus support the reliability analysis of SoSs through simulation.},

  abstract={In this paper, a method is proposed for extraction of coupled networks from layout information for simulation of electrothermal device behavior. The networks represent a three-dimensional (3-D) device structure with circuit elements. The electrical and thermal characteristics of this circuit representation are calculated with a circuit simulator. Spatial potential distributions, current flows, and temperature distributions in the device structure are calculated on the spatial coordinates. This simulation method can be placed between device simulation and (conventional) circuit simulation. It has been implemented in a circuit simulator and is demonstrated for simulation of self-heating in a bipolar low frequency power transistor. The main advantage of this simulation method is that not only the 3-D thermal behavior of the whole chip is simulated, but that this is also directly coupled to the electrical device behavior by means of the power dissipation and temperature distribution in the device. This offers the possibility for the circuit designer to simulate 3-D, coupled, thermal-electrical problems with a circuit simulator. As an example, the influence of the emitter contacting on the internal temperature and current distribution of a BJT is investigated.},

  abstract={To achieve model reuse in combat effectiveness simulation systems development, cognitive decision behaviors are usually implemented using a scripting language, which is separate from the programming language used to implement simulation models. Therefore, it is desirable to establish a much better grounding for cognitive behaviors modeling. In the context of domain specific modeling, metamodeling from scratch for designing such a scripting language poses some limitations, among which is the issue of integrating various models that are represented by various customized languages with different syntax and semantics, together with a large expenditure of designing, implementing, and maintaining these languages and their supporting resources. Instead, UML profile-based metamodeling is adopted, as a lightweight extension to capture the cognitive domain specific concepts, relationships, and constraints. Moreover, a unifying framework is proposed to guide the cognitive domain specific profiles design. Upon this framework, the development process is shown through constructing an anti-submarine tactical profile in combat effectiveness simulation systems domain and the feasibility of the domain specific language is illustrated with an armed escort scenario.},

  abstract={Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS) provide great value to our lives, but they also cause data overload problems. Data-driven personalized recommendation service is one of the most efficient means to solve such problems, which is currently receiving wide attention from research and industrial communities. The most important task of personalized recommender systems is to predict the click-through rate of given items, which is especially true for personalized advertisement recommendation systems. Recently, a number of deep click-through models have been proposed, which obtain low-dimensional dense embedding vectors of features, and then concatenate together and input into multi-layer perceptron to learn the nonlinear relationship between the features. However, the existing models don't dig deep enough into the user preferences and habits in users’ behavior history. In this paper, we propose a new model: Self-attention based Deep Neural Network (DeepSA), which addresses this issue by constructing Ad-related graph and training graph embedding vectors to enhance the representation of the advertisement for capturing user interests, and learns the internal correlation between user behaviors via the self-attention mechanism, which better explores interests and preferences hidden in users’ historical behaviors. Experiments on two public datasets and an industrial dataset demonstrate the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art models.},

  abstract={Due to the increasing level of integration achieved by Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) technology, traditional gate-level fault simulation is becoming more complex, difficult, and costly. Furthermore, circuit designs are increasingly being developed through the use of powerful VLSI computer-aided design (CAD) synthesis tools which emphasize circuit descriptions using high-level representations of functional behavior, rather than physical architectures and layout. Behavior fault simulation applied to the top functional level models described using a hardware description language offers a very attractive alternative to these problems. A new way to simulate the behavioral fault models using the hardware description language (HDL), such as VHDL, is presented. Tests were generated by carrying out the behavioral fault simulation for a few circuit models. For comparison, a gate-level fault simulation on the equivalent circuit, produced via a synthesis tool, was used. The performance analysis shows that a very small number of test patterns generated by the behavioral automatic test pattern generation (ATPG)/fault simulation system detected around 98 percent of the testable gate-level faults that were detected by random test.},

  abstract={Since the last century, the exponential growth of the semiconductor industry has led to the creation of tiny and complex integrated circuits, e.g., sensors, actuators, and smart power. Innovative techniques are needed to ensure the correct functionality of analog devices that are ubiquitous in every smart system. The ISO 26262 standard for functional safety in the automotive context specifies that fault injection is necessary to validate all electronic devices. For decades, standardization of defect modeling and injection mainly focused on digital circuits and, in a minor part, on analog ones. An initial attempt is being made with the IEEE P2427 draft standard that started to give a structured and formal organization to the analog testing field. Various methods have been proposed in the literature to speed up the fault simulation of the defect universe for an analog circuit. A more limited number of papers seek to reduce the overall simulation time by reducing the number of defects to be simulated. This literature survey describes the state-of-the-art of analog defect injection and the fault simulation methods. The survey is based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) methodological flow, allowing for a systematic and complete literature survey. Each selected paper has been categorized and presented to provide an overview of all the available approaches. In addition, the limitations of the various approaches are discussed by showing possible future directions.},

  pages={80986-80995},
  abstract={The social interaction is one of the necessary skills for social robots to better integrate into human society. However, current social robots interact mainly through audio and visual means with little reliance on haptic interaction. There still exist many obstacles for social robots to interact through touch: 1) the complex manufacturing process of the tactile sensor array is the main obstacle to lowering the cost of production; 2) the haptic interaction mode is complex and diverse. There are no social robot interaction standards and data sets for tactile interactive behavior in the public domain. In view of this, our research looks into the following aspects of tactile perception system: 1) Development of low-cost tactile sensor array, including sensor principle, simulation, manufacture, front-end electronics, examination, then applied to the social robot's whole body; 2) Establishment of the tactile interactive model and an event-triggered perception model in a social interactive application for the social robot, then design preprocessing and classification algorithm. In this research, we use k-nearest neighbors, tree, support vector machine and other classification algorithms to classify touch behaviors into six different classes. In particular, the cosine k-nearest neighbors and quadratic support vector machine achieve an overall mean accuracy rate of more than 68%, with an individual accuracy rate of more than 80%. In short, our research provides new directions in achieving low-cost intelligent touch interaction for social robots in a real environment. The low-cost tactile sensor array solution and interactive models are expected to be applied to social robots on a large scale.},

  abstract={We have investigated a damped oscillatory behavior of domain wall propagation in wavy nanowires under an external field higher than the Walker breakdown field using micromagnetic simulation. In nanowires having sinusoidal edge distortions with variation of wavelengths, domain wall has been observed to pseudomorphically follow the sinusoidal wires with keeping an intrinsic transformational frequency of inner wall spin structure. Oscillation amplitude of the domain wall position decreases as the wavelength of the wire decreases by an interaction between the periodically distributed spins and the propagating domain wall. Oscillatory behavior of the domain wall position is found to decay in a wire having the wavelength well matching with an intrinsic transformational frequency of the propagating domain wall.},

  abstract={Increasing use of electronic healthcare (eHealth) services demands efficient and secure solutions. Such solutions need to ensure the prevention of unauthorized access to the patient data and provide faster response. Fog computing is a viable solution to provide faster responses in eHealth systems. Key distribution and authentication play a major role in providing security to patient data. Existing centralized architectures are susceptible to single-point-of-compromise, that is, the entire system is vulnerable when the centralized authority keys are unexpectedly revealed to an adversary. In this article, we present a fog-based semi-centralized architecture for key distribution and authentication, in which the key distribution service is delegated to individual fog servers. Thus, the fog servers become responsible for key distribution to the users without the involvement of the centralized authority, which forms a paradigm of multiple client–server architecture. Thus, achieving centralized trust by designing a single sign-on authentication in such environments is a challenging problem. We design a single sign-on authentication protocol for semi-centralized architectures to achieve centralized trust by ensuring that the user keys are independent of the centralized authority’s keys. A rigorous security analysis under the random oracle model is performed to prove that the proposed protocol is secure against single-point-of-compromise. We also conduct extensive experiments to show the practical perspectives of the proposed scheme. The results show that the protocol is suitable for eHealth applications, including emergency services.},

  abstract={Academic research has brought attention to the utility of mobile health (mHealth) interventions for assisting cancer patients and survivors in managing their medication, symptoms, and well-being. This is a vital research area, as cancer is the second main cause of death for the global populace. However, the knowledge on mHealth interventions for cancer is distinctly fragmented and there is a lack of clarity on its boundaries, which hinders identification of existing gaps and valuable areas in which to advance future article. This article addresses this gap and provides a comprehensive review of extant literature to determine the core areas of discourse. This systematic literature review (SLR) amalgamates the extant findings related to users’ (cancer patients, cancer survivors, healthcare providers, and clients) experiences of mHealth interventions. Following rigorous protocols, we reviewed pertinent literature from Scopus and Web of Science databases to curate 78 studies. Grounded theory was adopted as an analytical framework and content analysis was used to explicate state-of-the-art insights. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive SLR on this topic. The findings revealed four themes and incumbent gaps: 1) intervention targets and affordances, 2) individual outcomes, 3) methodological approaches, and 4) intervention resistance or adoption. Our findings contribute to theory by proposing key areas for meaningful future article. Additionally, our findings provide crucial inputs to practitioners, such as app developers and healthcare personnel, to improve user engagement with mHealth interventions.},

  abstract={The case experience of anesthesiologists is one of the leading causes of accidental dural punctures and failed epidurals-the most common complications of epidural analgesia used for pain relief during delivery. We designed a bimanual haptic simulator to train anesthesiologists and optimize epidural analgesia skill acquisition. We present an assessment study conducted with 22 anesthesiologists of different competency levels from several Israeli hospitals. Our simulator emulates the forces applied to the epidural (Touhy) needle, held by one hand, and those applied to the Loss of Resistance (LOR) syringe, held by the other one. The resistance is calculated based on a model of the epidural region layers parameterized by the weight of the patient. We measured the movements of both haptic devices and quantified the results' rate (success, failed epidurals, and dural punctures), insertion strategies, and the participants' answers to questionnaires about their perception of the simulation realism. We demonstrated good construct validity by showing that the simulator can distinguish between real-life novices and experts. Face and content validity were examined by studying users' impressions regarding the simulator's realism and fulfillment of purpose. We found differences in strategies between different level anesthesiologists, and suggest trainee-based instruction in advanced training stages.},

  pages={2455-2469},
  abstract={Detailed cycle-accurate simulation of multicore systems is naturally slow. Statistical simulation is one alternative that permits trading off simulation speed for accuracy. However, there is a lack of effective memory locality models for multicore applications. Hence, existing statistical simulators neglect data-sharing between threads. Additionally, the standard method to speed up statistical simulations is to blindly reduce the trace length to be synthesized. While this gives good control over the speedup, it leaves the simulation error unbounded. In this work, we introduce a novel statistical simulation methodology for exploration of shared-memory multicore systems. It includes a new sharing-locality model (Shalom) that captures and reproduces data-sharing in multithread applications. Furthermore, we propose a method to bound the simulation error for a particular metric while maximizing speedup. The technique works by monitoring the convergence of the statistical synthesis. It is referred to as convergence-deterministic simulation (Condens). The combination of Shalom and Condens is around 130x faster than cycle-accurate simulations with reasonable accuracy loss. Our approach is also 5x faster than state-of-the-art sampling simulation under the same accuracy level. Compared to previous statistical simulators ignoring sharing, our approach is 2x more accurate for performance metrics and 8x more accurate for cache miss estimations.},

  abstract={In shared human-robot environments, effective navigation requires robots to adapt to various pedestrian behaviors encountered in the real world. Most existing deep reinforcement learning algorithms for human-aware robot navigation typically assume that pedestrians adhere to a single walking behavior during training, limiting their practicality/performance in scenarios where pedestrians exhibit various types of behavior. In this work, we propose to enhance the generalization capabilities of human-aware robot navigation by employing Domain Randomization (DR) techniques to train navigation policies on a diverse range of simulated pedestrian behaviors with the hope of better generalization to the real world. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method by comparing the generalization capabilities of a robot navigation policy trained with and without DR, both in simulations and through a real-user study, focusing on adaptability to different pedestrian behaviors, performance in novel environments, and users' perceived comfort, sociability and naturalness. Our findings reveal that the use of DR significantly enhances the robot's social compliance in both simulated and real-life contexts.},

This research proposes integration of CCRO:Citations’ Context and Reasons Ontology’s (Ihsan and Qadir, 2019) taxonomic hierarchy of reasons within document.

  title={Modeling the dynamic behavior of supercapacitors using impedance spectroscopy}, 
  year={2002},
  volume={38},
  number={6},
  pages={1622-1626},
  abstract={This paper presents a new approach of modeling the dynamic behavior of supercapacitors using impedance spectroscopy. The new Matlab/Simulink model can be used in simulating the voltage response and energy efficiency, e.g., for automotive power systems. The model in the frequency domain, the parameter calculation, as well as the inverse transformation into the time domain are discussed. Furthermore, simulation results are compared with experimental data. As application example, the new model is used to analyze the energy dissipation of a supercapacitor module installed in a 42-V mild-hybrid vehicle.},

  title={Ship Collision Avoidance and COLREGS Compliance Using Simulation-Based Control Behavior Selection With Predictive Hazard Assessment}, 
  year={2016},
  volume={17},
  number={12},
  pages={3407-3422},
  abstract={This paper describes a concept for a collision avoidance system for ships, which is based on model predictive control. A finite set of alternative control behaviors are generated by varying two parameters: offsets to the guidance course angle commanded to the autopilot and changes to the propulsion command ranging from nominal speed to full reverse. Using simulated predictions of the trajectories of the obstacles and ship, compliance with the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea and collision hazards associated with each of the alternative control behaviors are evaluated on a finite prediction horizon, and the optimal control behavior is selected. Robustness to sensing error, predicted obstacle behavior, and environmental conditions can be ensured by evaluating multiple scenarios for each control behavior. The method is conceptually and computationally simple and yet quite versatile as it can account for the dynamics of the ship, the dynamics of the steering and propulsion system, forces due to wind and ocean current, and any number of obstacles. Simulations show that the method is effective and can manage complex scenarios with multiple dynamic obstacles and uncertainty associated with sensors and predictions.},

  title={Measurement Methodology for Accurate Modeling of SiC MOSFET Switching Behavior Over Wide Voltage and Current Ranges}, 
  year={2018},
  volume={33},
  number={9},
  pages={7314-7325},
  abstract={This paper presents two novel measurement methods to characterize silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFET devices. The resulting data are utilized to significantly improve the extraction of a custom device model that can now accurately reproduce device switching behavior. First, we consider the $I_{\text{d}}- V_{\text{ds}}$ output characteristics of power devices such as SiC transistors. These are typically measured using traditional curve tracers, but the characterization of the high-voltage and high-current (HVHC) region is very challenging because of device power compliance and self-heating. In this paper, we introduce a measurement technique that overcomes self-heating and derives the HVHC region from switching waveforms. The switching transient characteristics of devices are used to determine drain current  $(I_{\text{d}})$ as a function of drain–source voltage  $(V_{\text{ds}})$ in the HVHC range. Second, we consider another challenging characterization area: measurement of nonlinear capacitances when device is turned on. These capacitance characteristics of on-state devices are important for correcting disagreements between simulations and measurements in turn-off switching transient waveforms and cannot be measured using a conventional capacitance-voltage meter. We introduce S-parameter measurements as an effective method to obtain the capacitance characteristics of both off-state devices and on-state devices. These novel measurement techniques have been applied to the modeling of a SiC device. The extracted device model, a modified version of the popular Angelov−GaN high-electron-mobility transistor model, shows significant improvement in terms of the accuracy of switching waveforms of devices over a wide range of operating conditions.},

  abstract={There is much more to modeling for circuit simulation than deriving a set of I(V), and perhaps Q(V), equations and extracting a SPICE MODEL card. Unfortunately, some practical aspects of modeling are often overlooked. This paper details common-sense guidelines for modeling and highlights common modeling problems. Particular emphasis is given on understanding accuracy requirements and numerical requirements, on ensuring that compact models are asymptotically correct, and on highlighting the real goal of modeling for circuit simulation: getting complete models for allowable device layouts working in the CAD system on a designer's desk.},

  title={Understanding Customer Behavior in Multi-Tier Demand Response Management Program}, 
  year={2015},
  volume={3},
  number={},
  pages={2613-2625},
  abstract={In this paper, we investigate the factors that influence the customer's decision in subscribing to a particular demand response management (DRM) scheme. Based on these factors, we suggest a classification of customer types that include non-green comfort seeking behavior (NCSB) and green incentive seeking behavior (GISB). We use multi-tier DRM plans that clearly specify the incentive and inconvenience for NCSB and GISB customers. The grid operator can obtain maximum profit margin (after paying out the incentives to participating users) from the DRM only if a specific number of customers participate in the NCSB and GISB plans. Any deviation from an ideal subscription pattern is undesirable from the grid's perspective. We also develop a mathematical framework that is based on logistic regression and considers the quantifiable as well as unquantifiable attributes of customer behavior. This model captures the probabilistic nature of customer preferences for different DRM plans. Simulation results reveal that the actual subscription of customers in NCSB and GISB plans significantly deviates from the ideal values. From these, we determine a compromise solution that lies between the ideal and the actual solutions. We also identify that along with economic factors, social factors, such as peer pressure and prompting green or caring behavior, could also be used as potential tools by the grid operator to influence the customer preference. This paper can also be used by the grid operator to design appropriate multi-tier DRM plans.},
