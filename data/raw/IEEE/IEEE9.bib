  abstract={In the environmental sector, in recent years, policies and governance of marine issues have seen greater enhancement of participatory and community-based processes (for example the Blue Growth Actions of the Interreg Med Program of the European Union). The greater involvement of citizens in the processes and policies of the sea can greatly benefit the survival of the marine environment and support reforms, since most environmental problems are caused by human behavior. Changes in individual behaviors are desirable to ensure sustainable use of the ocean and its resources. These changes are possible only if there is an improvement in people's knowledge and awareness since the childhood. Ocean literacy interventions will allow people to understand their responsibilities towards the oceans and their health. For this reason, it is necessary to promote sustainable behavior changes using new educational approaches that can be effective with young pupils. The research presents a serious game and an explainer video, used in order to introduce the problem of marine litter, one of the main dangers for the marine species. The aim of the serious game was to enhance ocean literacy with a particular attention to the biodiversity of the Apulian and Mediterranean sea to raise children's awareness of the issue of caring for life in the sea. The measure of learning effectiveness confirmed that the knowledge gained can be actually acquired by children using new technologies, in general, and serious games in particular.},

  abstract={The cost to society of mental illness is substantial. A large scale international study has identified mental illnesses as the second leading cause of disability and premature mortality in the developed world [Murray, C.L., Lopez, A.D. (Eds.), 1996. The Global Burden of Disease: A comprehensive assessment of mortality and disability from disease, injuries, and risk factors in 1990 and projected to 2020. Harvard University, Cambridge, MA]. Unfortunately, research also suggests that the majority of people suffering from treatable mental health disorders do not have access to the required treatment. Furthermore, even when treatment is accessible many sufferers are unable to successfully engage with professional services [Surgeon General, 1999. Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General – Executive Summary, Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, DC, Retrieved August 2006, from http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/mentalhealth/home.html; WHO World Mental Health Survey Consortium, 2004. Prevalence, severity, and unmet need for treatment of mental disorders in the World Health Organization World Mental Health Surveys. Journal of the American Medical Association, 291(21)]. Computer assisted mental health interventions have the potential to help in addressing this imbalance. However, a review of literature shows that to date this potential has been largely unexplored. One of the primary reasons for this is that few researchers from a HCI or technical background have engaged in this area. The primary purpose of this paper is to provide a foundation and set an agenda for future research on the design of technology for talk-based mental health interventions. Theoretical approaches to the treatment of mental illness are reviewed, as is previous research on the use of technology in this area. Several significant factors effecting design and evaluation are identified and based on these factors a broad set of design guidelines are proposed to aid the development of new technologies. Of the issues identified, ethical requirements along with the sensitivity and stigma associated with mental illness pose particular challenges to HCI professionals. These factors place strict limitations on access to mental health care (MHC) settings by non-MHC professionals and create difficulties for the direct application of traditional HCI methods, such as participatory, user-centred and iterative design. To overcome these difficulties this paper proposes a model for collaborative design and evaluation, involving both HCI and MHC professionals. The development of adaptable technologies is an important element of the proposed approach. The final contribution of the paper is to suggest future research directions and identify ways in which HCI researchers can contribute to this work.},

  year={2008},
  volume={20},
  number={1},
  pages={1-19},
  abstract={Mental rotation is a hypothesized imagery process that has inspired controversy regarding the substrate of human spatial reasoning. Two central questions about mental rotation remain: Does mental rotation depend on analog spatial representations, and does mental rotation depend on motor simulation? A review and meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies help answer these questions. Mental rotation is accompanied by increased activity in the intraparietal sulcus and adjacent regions. These areas contain spatially mapped representations, and activity in these areas is modulated by parametric manipulations of mental rotation tasks, supporting the view that mental rotation depends on analog representations. Mental rotation also is accompanied by activity in the medial superior precentral cortex, particularly under conditions that favor motor simulation, supporting the view that mental rotation depends on motor simulation in some situations. The relationship between mental rotation and motor simulation can be understood in terms of how these two processes update spatial reference frames.},

  year={2024},
  volume={16},

  pages={409-418},
  abstract={Brain–computer interface (BCI) establishes an alternative direct communication channel between the brain and computer or other external devices. Motion-onset visual-evoked potential (mVEP) related to the individual perception of movement is among synchronous BCI system that utilizes external stimulus. mVEPs stimulation paradigm is like an oddball stimulation paradigm. Researchers have recently been investigating mVEPs to control a computer game. To control a computer game, they used translation stimulus to evoke these potentials in electroencephalography brain signals. In this study, we examine designing a computer game with four different types of stimuli, including translation, contraction, expansion, and rotation. We also used the time-domain and wavelet coefficients for the feature extraction. Also, we used different types of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classification methods, including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, stepwise LDA (SWLDA); moreover, and spatial–temporal discriminant analysis (STDA) for detecting the target stimulus. Our results demonstrate that contraction, expansion, and rotation stimuli, as well as translation, could be employed to control a BCI game. Our results showed that subjects got higher scores, game accuracy control, and information transfer rate using the rotation stimulus with SWLDA/STDA classification methods.},

  year={2016},
  volume={63},

  pages={2021-2035},
  abstract={Objective: Like all scientific research, computational neuroscience research must be reproducible. Big data science, including simulation research, cannot depend exclusively on journal articles as the method to provide the sharing and transparency required for reproducibility. Methods: Ensuring model reproducibility requires the use of multiple standard software practices and tools, including version control, strong commenting and documentation, and code modularity. Results: Building on these standard practices, model-sharing sites and tools have been developed that fit into several categories: 1) standardized neural simulators; 2) shared computational resources; 3) declarative model descriptors, ontologies, and standardized annotations; and 4) model-sharing repositories and sharing standards. Conclusion: A number of complementary innovations have been proposed to enhance sharing, transparency, and reproducibility. The individual user can be encouraged to make use of version control, commenting, documentation, and modularity in development of models. The community can help by requiring model sharing as a condition of publication and funding. Significance: Model management will become increasingly important as multiscale models become larger, more detailed, and correspondingly more difficult to manage by any single investigator or single laboratory. Additional big data management complexity will come as the models become more useful in interpreting experiments, thus increasing the need to ensure clear alignment between modeling data, both parameters and results, and experiment.},

  abstract={Cultural heritage (CH) artifacts, such as ceramics and clothes, reflect the unique characteristics of ancient cultures and have the potential to be sustainably employed in modern design and entertainment. In particular, the shape of ceramics reflects regional and historical characteristics, so datafication is a promising avenue to preserve these assets for future generations. However, design is a specialized domain that requires significant human (expert and novice) labor. This often tedious process decreases the labeler's motivation to complete the task, and data consistency varies with the experience and motivation of the labeler. To increase engagement, we developed an image labeling platform with graphical icon-based labeling methods and introduced gamification. The robust labeling methods with gamification increased novices' engagement and decreased the workload of expert and novice labelers, but decreased data agreement between experts and novices, so we consider opportunities for gamification within the specialized cultural heritage domain.},

  abstract={Crowds must be simulated believable in terms of their appearance and behavior to improve a virtual environment's realism. Due to the complex nature of human behavior, realistic behavior of agents in crowd simulations is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel behavioral model which builds analytical maps to control agents’ behavior adaptively with agent–crowd interaction formulations. We introduce information theoretical concepts to construct analytical maps automatically. Our model can be integrated into crowd simulators and enhance their behavioral complexity. We made comparative analyses of the presented behavior model with measured crowd data and two agent-based crowd simulators.},

  year={2018},
  volume={37},
  number={1},
  pages={93-105},
  abstract={By exploiting cross-information among multiple imaging data, multimodal fusion has often been used to better understand brain diseases. However, most current fusion approaches are blind, without adopting any prior information. There is increasing interest to uncover the neurocognitive mapping of specific clinical measurements on enriched brain imaging data; hence, a supervised, goal-directed model that employs prior information as a reference to guide multimodal data fusion is much needed and becomes a natural option. Here, we proposed a fusion with reference model called “multi-site canonical correlation analysis with reference + joint-independent component analysis” (MCCAR+jICA), which can precisely identify co-varying multimodal imaging patterns closely related to the reference, such as cognitive scores. In a three-way fusion simulation, the proposed method was compared with its alternatives on multiple facets; MCCAR+jICA outperforms others with higher estimation precision and high accuracy on identifying a target component with the right correspondence. In human imaging data, working memory performance was utilized as a reference to investigate the co-varying working memory-associated brain patterns among three modalities and how they are impaired in schizophrenia. Two independent cohorts (294 and 83 subjects respectively) were used. Similar brain maps were identified between the two cohorts along with substantial overlaps in the central executive network in fMRI, salience network in sMRI, and major white matter tracts in dMRI. These regions have been linked with working memory deficits in schizophrenia in multiple reports and MCCAR+jICA further verified them in a repeatable, joint manner, demonstrating the ability of the proposed method to identify potential neuromarkers for mental disorders.},

  abstract={Making students become intrinsically motivated to participate in daily class activities is an open challenge that has been addressed in different ways. In this article, we evaluate the impact of an educational innovation project, named TrivialCV, in terms of student motivation, engagement, and learning outcomes. We analyze the impact of two types of activities: multiplayer team-based competitions created for delivery during a live class session and single-player competitions created to be played asynchronously from home. We deployed these activities in two different computer engineering courses (programming fundamentals and operating systems) and used questionnaires, grades, and activity tracking in the virtual campus to evaluate their impact. After the analysis, we can assert that the use of TrivialCV activities was useful for providing additional motivation to the students and improving their engagement with the courses in which they were deployed. TrivialCV activities were very well received by the students, who considered them fun, engaging, and useful.},

The disruption of any components of the equilibrioceptive, proprioceptive, or visual systems can significantly handicap balance, such as in some cases of cerebral palsy, spina bifida, arthrogryposis, cystic fibrosis, and many other diseases and injuries. Unfortunately, in patients with damaged brain function the disorder at the root of the problem cannot typically be treated but, with physical therapy and braces or other aids, the balance handicap may be overcome.},

We present the results of a campaign with iCO2 that used a game promoter to attract 2455 users. The results are described from three angles: (1) types of drivers are identified by clustering driving behavior; (2) types of players are identified by relating players' interaction with game elements and their driving behavior; (3) by looking at longer sessions, we demonstrate that players who show eco-unfriendly behavior at the beginning of the session improve their eco-driving behavior throughout their playtime.},

This is done by encoding and presenting color conversion per word and character, using a certain color code. The proposed system is a combination of color-coding technique, transliteration, and text-to-speech technologies that creates an educational tool for learning the Arabic language. It also provides web services for developers who want to integrate the system into their own applications.},

  abstract={This article is a systematic literature review that explores aspects of collaboration in the context of gamification in multiplayer gaming environments, highlighting the potential of gamification to increase engagement and intrinsic motivation in various sectors through the application of game elements, and identifying research needs on gamification that support collaboration. The main focus of this literature review is to gain a deep understanding of the concept of gamification, particularly in multiplayer environments that support collaboration between players. To clarify this research, we formulate it into three research questions. RQ1: What are the latest trends in gamification, particularly in a multiplayer context? RQ2: What are the most commonly used methods for developing gamification in multiplayer environments? RQ3: How is gamification used in collaborative aspects of multiplayer environments? A formal protocol was followed to perform an automated search for relevant articles published between January 2018 and October 2023, adopting the Kitchenham method. The result obtained 44 selected articles for further study. Through systematic analysis of the relevant literature, this article identifies domains, technologies, theories, frameworks, models, gamification elements, impacts, and other key findings related to gamification that support collaboration aspects in multiplayer environments. The findings of this review are expected to provide a solid knowledge base for further research in developing more effective and engaging gamification strategies to foster collaboration between players.},

  abstract={Game designers and researchers have sought to create gameful environments that consider user preferences to increase engagement and motivation. In this sense, it is essential to identify the most suitable game elements for users' profiles. Designers and researchers must choose strategies to classify users into predefined profiles and select the most appropriate game elements for each user. This activity may challenge designers, learning designers, and researchers since they must base their choice on personal aspects that require a deep understanding. Therefore, this article aims to assist game designers, learning designers, and researchers in selecting user classification strategies to customize and personalize game-based and gamified learning environments. By conducting systematic literature mapping, we consolidate the most common strategies and explore their applications in games and gamification. Our analysis, based on 25 publications, reveals that we can classify the strategies according to user interaction, user personality, learning style, and motivation for learning. Strategies based on user interactions emerge as the most popular, while questionnaires and log data systems are commonly used instruments for identifying user profiles. The findings of this SLM offer valuable knowledge for game designers and researchers to define the criteria that will be used to evaluate the effect of games and gamified environments in educational contexts.},

  abstract={Serious games for safety education (SGSE) are a novel tool for preparing people to prevent and\or handle risky situations. Although several SGSE have been developed, design and evaluation methods for SGSE need to be better grounded in and guided by safety-relevant psychological theories. In particular, this paper focuses on threat appeals and the assessment of variables, such as safety locus of control, that influence human behavior in real risky situations. It illustrates how we took into account such models in the design and evaluation of “Learn to Brace”, a first-of-its-kind serious game that deals with a major problem in aviation safety, i.e. the scarce effectiveness of the safety cards used by airlines. The study considered a sample of 48 users: half of them received instructions about the brace position through the serious game, the other half through a traditional safety card pictorial. Results showed that the serious game was much more effective than the traditional instructions both in terms of learning and of changing safety-relevant perceptions, especially safety locus of control and recommendation perception.},

  abstract={Autism - also known as Autism Spectrum Disorders or Autism Spectrum Conditions - is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by repetitive behaviours and differences in communication and social interaction. As a consequence, many autistic individuals may struggle in everyday life, which sometimes manifests in depression, unemployment, or addiction. One crucial problem in patient support and treatment is the long waiting time to diagnosis, which was approximated to seven months on average. Yet, the earlier an intervention can take place the better the patient can be supported, which was identified as a crucial factor. We propose a system to support the screening of Autism Spectrum Disorders based on a virtual reality social interaction, namely a shopping experience, with an embodied agent. During this everyday interaction, behavioral responses are tracked and recorded. We analyze this behavior with machine learning approaches to classify participants from an autistic participant sample in comparison to a typically developed individuals control sample with high accuracy, demonstrating the feasibility of the approach. We believe that such tools can strongly impact the way mental disorders are assessed and may help to further find objective criteria and categorization.},

  abstract={This article proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm to perform automated analysis and detection of gameplay issues in complex 3-D navigation environments. The curiosity-conditioned proximal trajectories (CCPT) method combines curiosity and imitation learning to train agents that methodically explore in the proximity of known trajectories derived from expert demonstrations. We show how our new algorithm can explore complex environments, discovering gameplay issues, and design oversights in the process, and recognize and highlight them directly to game designers. We also propose a visual analytics interface to aid interpretation of results from the method. This interface transforms information from complex models into interpretable and interactive visual forms. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in a novel 3-D navigation environment, which reflects the complexity of modern video games. Our results show a higher level of coverage and bug discovery than baseline methods, demonstrating that our method can be a useful tool for game designers to automatically identify design issues. Moreover, our experiments show that the visual explanations provided by the analytics interface result in a significant increase in user trust and acceptance of automated playtesting and increased confidence in the use of machine learning techniques for video game development.},

  abstract={Fostering prosocial behaviors in students is not only beneficial for their emotional well-being and personal growth but also contributes to a positive school environment and the formation of responsible citizens. The objective of the research is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Sandbox video game Minecraft in promoting prosocial behaviors in students of Regular Basic Education. An experimental methodology was employed, applying the game to the students and administering a pretest and posttest based on the “Prosocial Skills Scale for Adolescents” (PSS-A), which measures solidarity, helping response, perspective, altruism, and assistance. Five personalized multiplayer gaming sessions were conducted. The results indicate that the game dynamics implemented over the five sessions significantly improved solidarity, helping response, perspective, altruism, and assistance among the students. A positive short-term influence on prosocial behavior was evident. The study suggests that the use of the Sandbox video game Minecraft can have a significant impact on fostering prosocial behaviors in students. These findings highlight the potential of video games as an educational tool to enhance social skills and responsible citizenship in the current school context. The research demonstrates that the use of video games like Minecraft in a Sandbox approach can effectively improve prosocial behavior in students of Regular Basic Education. However, the need for future research to examine the long-term durability of these effects and consider the integration of video games into educational programs more broadly and strategically is emphasized.},

  abstract={Individual differences in motivation can explain why people act differently in the same situation, and which aspects of a game people with different motive profiles may find most engaging. However, identifying a player’s motive profile from data available during gameplay remains an open research question. Besides a range of subjective and objective techniques for identifying player motivation, electroencephalography (EEG) technology could offer an automatic, objective technique for identifying the profile that best describes a given player. This article proposes a framework to measure player profiles of achievement, affiliation, and power motivation using EEG signals during their engagement within a game. First, an abstract mini-game is proposed to evaluate a player’s motivation. In the mini-game, each human player interacts with four nonplayer characters to gain fortune or friendship through an individual play phase and a social network phase. The game is used within an experimental scenario to collect players’ actions and EEG signals. In addition, data from a psychological test are used to establish ground truth. We propose three subject labeling schemes using the output of the psychological test. Based on a player’s motive profile, behavioral indicators and EEG data analysis indicate that assessing a player’s motive profile is more robust from EEG signals than from behavioral data.},

  abstract={Recent evidence in cognitive neuroscience has suggested that attention is a complex organ system subserved by at least three attentional networks in the brain, for alerting, orienting, and executive control functions. However, how these different networks work together to give rise to the seemingly unitary mental faculty of attention remains unclear. We describe a connectionist model of human attentional networks to explore the possible interplays among the networks from a computational perspective. This model is developed in the framework of leabra (local, error-driven, and associative, biologically realistic algorithm) and simultaneously involves these attentional networks connected in a biologically inspired way. We evaluate the model by simulating the empirical data collected on normal human subjects using the Attentional Network Test (ANT). The simulation results fit the experimental data well. In addition, we show that the same model, with a single parameter change that affects executive control, is able to simulate the empirical data collected from patients with schizophrenia. This model represents a plausible connectionist explanation for the functional structure and interaction of human attentional networks.},

  year={2018},
  volume={11},
  number={4},
  pages={520-535},
  abstract={Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that impairs the development of social and communication skills. There is evidence that children with ASD prefer images of self over others[1] . These studies may explain the effectiveness of video self-modeling (VSM), an evidence-based ASD intervention in which one learns by watching oneself on video performing a target behavior. VSM content is difficult to create as target behaviors are sporadic. In this paper, we propose the MEBook system which uses a Kinect sensor to inject self-images into a gesture-based social narrative to teach children with ASD proper greeting behaviors. MEBook consists of two components. The first component is a social narrative. A social narrative is an animated story about the main character meeting and greeting different cartoon characters in a particular setting. Self-modeling is achieved by first replacing the main characters face with an image of the learner, and then animating the learner's body and voice to match the narration. The second component is a positive reinforcement practice session in which the subject is prompted to greet different cartoon characters. Through depth-based body posture tracking, proper greeting behaviors are recognized and immediately reinforced with praise and visual confetti. Novel computational multimedia tools are proposed to turn video recordings of successful attempts into VSM content, thereby alleviating the tedious production process. A multiple-baseline single subject pilot study has been conducted and the preliminary results show that MEBook is potentially effective in teaching greeting behaviors to children with ASD.},

  abstract={Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by core deficits in social interaction and communication. Collaborative puzzle games are interactive activities that can be played to foster the collaboration and verbal-communication skills of children with ASD. In this article, we have designed an intelligent agent that can play collaborative puzzle games with children and verbally communicate with them as if it is another human player. Furthermore, this intelligent agent is also able to automatically measure children's task-performance and verbal-communication behaviors throughout the game play. Two preliminary studies were conducted with children with ASD to evaluate the feasibility and performance of the intelligent agent. Results of Study I demonstrated the intelligent agent's ability to play games and communicate with children within the game-playing domain. Results of Study II indicated its potential to measure the communication and collaboration skills of human users.},

  title={Using an Online Serious Game to Teach Basic Programming Concepts and Facilitate Gameful Experiences for High School Students}, 
  year={2021},

  pages={12567-12578},
  abstract={Teaching programming to pre-university students has attracted a great deal of attention in the last years. The benefits of teaching programming before University have been investigated by taking several approaches to improve the students’ learning scores, motivation and satisfaction levels. Serious Games (SGs) are also gaining an increasing research interest for education. SGs can be defined as games designed for a primary goal other for than pure entertainment. In the case of this paper, the DFD-C serious game has been created to investigate whether High School students will improve their learning of programming fundamentals and, if there are gender differences in the improvement. Moreover, it is explored the perception of the gameful experience by the students when using a serious game such as DFD-C, and if this perception is different in the case of boys or girls. An experiment with 38 K-10 High School students has been carried out during the 2019–2020 academic year. All students took a pre-test at the beginning of the experiment. After that, they were randomly split into a control group (no use of DFD-C) and a test group (use of DFD-C). Finally, all of them took the same test (post-test) to measure their learning gains. The test group also completed the Gamefulquest questionnaire to evaluate their perception of the gameful experience. A significant improvement in the scores of the test students was registered, with no gender differences. Moreover, the answers to the Gamefulquest reveal that students had a positive gameful experience, being the ratings of the girls slightly higher than boys. It is concluded that using SGs to teach learning programming fundamentals to High School students increased their learning scores and students perceived the sense of playfulness, guidance and social experience of the SG without having significant differences between girls and boys.},

  abstract={Emotion is defined (from Britannica) as a complex combination of experiences of consciousness, bodily sensation and behavior, reflecting personal significance of externally and/or internally triggered changes. As an indispensable part of human communication, emotions could be represented within the digital world as a means that could control human interaction with digital artifacts. When this is combined with gamification, a more engaging communication for the player could be established. In this article, we explore how multisensed emotions of players could be used as adaptation controllers within the emotion-adpting serious neurogames (SNGs). We first briefly describe the emotion sensing and recognition landscape, examining the emotion-source sensing and emotion inferring approaches. We then discuss the SNGs design framework and the way human-to-SNG communication is set. Additionally, we describe the way the adaptation of the SNG characteristics can be driven by the inferred emotions, towards the achievement of the desired SNG goals. In addition, we demonstrate the feasibility and design characteristics of multisensed emotion-adapting SNGs, by presenting a related application case, namely EmoSense, and evaluate its acceptance as a technological solution in the field of neurofeedback. Finally, we discuss challenges and opportunities in the field.},

  abstract={In spite of their effectiveness, learning environments often fail to engage users and end up under-used. Many studies show that gamification of learning environments can enhance learners' motivation to use learning environments. However, learners react differently to specific game mechanics and little is known about how to adapt gaming features to learners' profiles. In this paper, we propose a process for adapting gaming features based on a player model. This model is inspired from existing player typologies and types of gamification elements. Our approach is implemented in a learning environment with five different gaming features, and evaluated with 266 participants. The main results of this study show that, amongst the most engaged learners (i.e., learners who use the environment the longest), those with adapted gaming features spend significantly more time in the learning environment. Furthermore, learners with features that are not adapted have a higher level of amotivation. These results support the relevance of adapting gaming features to enhance learners' engagement, and provide cues on means to implement adaptation mechanisms.},

  abstract={In this article, we present an approach to generate a team of general video game playing agents with differentiated behaviors that can ultimately assist in the game development process. We consider the agent behavior as the corresponding outcomes of playing the game: rate of wins, score, exploration, enemies killed, items collected, etc. We create and identify agents that are expected to achieve particular goals but do not necessarily simulate human behavior during gameplay. We present a solution that, by heuristic diversification, provides a controller with different heuristics and a corresponding set of weights, driving its actions. Given the simplicity of this behavior-encoding and its easiness to evolve, we use Multidimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites to generate different solutions that elicit particular behaviors and assemble a team. The resulting agents are allocated in a feature space, used to identify the expectations of each of them. We generate a team for four games of the General Video Game Artificial Intelligence framework and find six different behavior-type agents in each. We include an experiment to check the portability of these agents when playing alternative levels and an exploratory work aiming to use them to detect design flaws in game levels.},

  pages={5709-5719},
  abstract={The identification of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) faces challenges due to the lack of reliable biomarkers and the subjectivity in diagnostic procedures, necessitating improved tools for objectivity and efficiency. Being a key characteristic of autism, language impairments are regarded as potential markers for identifying ASD. However, current research predominantly focuses on analyzing language characteristics in English, overlooking linguistic and contextual specificities in other resource-constrained languages. Motivated by these, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-based system to detect ASD, utilizing a range of acoustic and linguistic features extracted from dyadic conversations between a child and their communication partner. Validating our model on 76 English-speaking children [35 ASD and 41 typically developing (TD)] and 33 Hindi-speaking children (15 ASD and 18 TD), our extensive analysis of a diverse and comprehensive set of acoustic and linguistic speech attributes, including lexical, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic elements revealed reliable speech attributes as predictors of ASD. This comprehensive analysis achieved a remarkable macro F1-score of approximately $\boldsymbol{\sim}$91.30%. We further addressed the influence of linguistic diversity on speech-based ASD assessment by examining speech behaviors in both English and the low-resource language, Hindi. Specific features such as adverbs and distinct roots contributed significantly to ASD classification in English, while the proportion of unintelligible utterances and adposition use held greater importance in Hindi. This study underscores the reliability of speech-based biomarkers in ASD assessment, emphasizing their effectiveness across diverse linguistic backgrounds and highlighting the need for language-specific research in this domain.},

  abstract={This paper augments recent advances in social cognitive and affective neuroscience (SCAN) and illustrates their relevance to the development of novel human-machine systems. Advances in this area are crucial for understanding and exploring the social, cognitive, and neural processes that arise during human interactions with complex sociotechnological systems. Overviews of the major areas of SCAN research, including emotion, theory of mind, and joint action, are provided as the basis for describing three applications of SCAN to human-machine systems research and development. Specifically, this paper provides three examples to demonstrate the broad interdisciplinary applicability of SCAN and the ways it can contribute to improving a number of human-machine systems with the pursuit of further research in this vein. These include applying SCAN to learning and training, informing the field of human-robot interaction (HRI), and, finally, for enhancing team performance. The goal is to draw attention to the insights that can be gained by integrating SCAN with ongoing human-machine system research and to provide guidance to foster collaborations of this nature. Toward this end, we provide a systematic set of notional research questions for each detailed application within the context of the three major emphases of SCAN research. In turn, this study serves as a roadmap for preliminary investigations that integrate SCAN and human-machine system research.},

  year={2003},

  pages={203-225},
  abstract={This paper presents a novel approach to usability evaluation with children called peer tutoring. Peer tutoring means that children teach other children to use the software that is evaluated. The basic philosophy behind this is to view software as a part of child's play, so that the teaching process is analogous to explaining the rules of a game such as hide and seek. If the software is easy to teach and learn, it is more likely that the amount of users increases in a social setting such as a school. The peer tutoring approach provides information about teachability and learnability of software and it also promotes communication in the test situation, compared to a test person communicating with an adult instructor. The approach has been applied to the development of a perceptually interactive user interface in QuiQui's Giant Bounce, a physically and vocally interactive computer game for 4–9 year old children. The results and experiences of using peer tutoring are promising and it has proved to be effective in detecting usability flaws and in improving the design of the game.},

  abstract={Objective: Attention decoding plays a vital role in daily life, where electroencephalography (EEG) has been widely involved. However, training a universally effective model for everyone is impractical due to substantial interindividual variability in EEG signals. To tackle the above challenge, we propose an end-to-end brain-computer interface (BCI) framework, including temporal and spatial one-dimensional (1D) convolutional neural network and domain-adversarial training strategy, namely DA-TSnet. Method: Specifically, DA-TSnet extracts temporal and spatial features of EEG, while it is jointly supervised by task loss and domain loss. During training, DA-TSnet aims to maximize the domain loss while simultaneously minimizing the task loss. We conduct an offline analysis, simulate online experiments on a self-collected dataset of 85 subjects, and real online experiments on 22 subjects. Main results: DA-TSnet achieves a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation (CV) classification accuracy of 89.40% $\pm$ 9.96%, outperforming several state-of-the-art attention EEG decoding methods. In simulated online experiments, DA-TSnet achieves an outstanding accuracy of 88.07% $\pm$ 11.22%. In real online experiments, it achieves an average accuracy surpassing 86%. Significance: An end-to-end network framework does not rely on elaborate preprocessing and feature extraction steps, which saves time and human workload. Moreover, our framework utilizes domain-adversarial training neural network (DANN) to tackle the challenge posed by the high interindividual variability in EEG signals, which has significant reference value for handling other EEG signal decoding issues. Last, the performance of the DA-TSnet framework in offline and online experiments underscores its potential to facilitate more reliable applications.},

  abstract={Monitoring human brain activity has great potential in helping us understand the functioning of our brain, as well as in preventing mental disorders and cognitive decline and improve our quality of life. Noninvasive surface EEG is the dominant modality for studying brain dynamics and performance in real-life interaction of humans with their environment. To take full advantage of surface EEG recordings, EEG technology has to be advanced to a level that it can be used in daily life activities. Furthermore, users have to see it as an unobtrusive option to monitor and improve their health. To achieve this, EEG systems have to be transformed from stationary, wired, and cumbersome systems used mostly in clinical practice today, to intelligent wearable, wireless, convenient, and comfortable lifestyle solutions that provide high signal quality. Here, we discuss state-of-the-art in wireless and wearable EEG solutions and a number of aspects where such solutions require improvements when handling electrical activity of the brain. We address personal traits and sensory inputs, brain signal generation and acquisition, brain signal analysis, and feedback generation. We provide guidelines on how these aspects can be advanced further such that we can develop intelligent wearable, wireless, lifestyle EEG solutions. We recognized the following aspects as the ones that need rapid research progress: application driven design, end-user driven development, standardization and sharing of EEG data, and development of sophisticated approaches to handle EEG artifacts.},

Scholars have noted that VR-based tools have yet to be adopted as anticipated despite their general usefulness in enabling learning for vulnerable groups, calling for more research into the causes. The present study contributes to this agenda by presenting a comprehensive review of the past literature to serve as a basis for future research. Employing the systematic literature review (SLR) approach, the study analyzed the contents of 56 relevant studies to present their research profile and critical discussions under three heads—context, approaches, and reasons for adoption/resistance. The study also uncovered research gaps in the reviewed literature and suggested research paths to guide future research. The analysis also served as the basis for offering functional theoretical and practical implications.},

  title={Gamifying Software Engineering Tools to Motivate Computer Science Students to Start and Finish Programming Assignments Earlier}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={64},
  number={4},
  pages={423-431},
  abstract={Contribution: Research has shown that computer science (CS) students who start programming assignments (PAs) early generally receive higher grades. This article presents and evaluates a gamification approach that utilizes software engineering tools to motivate CS students to start and finish PAs earlier. Background: CS can be difficult to learn because students often struggle with errors and how to properly test their code. For these reasons, it is essential that students start their PAs early. Furthermore, software engineering tools, such as version control and unit testing, are increasingly important for students to learn early in their career. Intended Outcomes: This gamification approach aims to motivate CS students to start and complete PAs earlier, as well as instill software engineering best practices. Application Design: To motivate students to start and finish assignments early, an open-source gamification system called the Leaderboard was developed. Using gamified points, the Leaderboard rewards students who pass PA unit tests well before the assignment is due. The system is fully automated using Github Classroom, a build server, and the Moodle learning management system. Findings: Results indicate students who used the Leaderboard did not start assignments significantly earlier; however, they finished assignments earlier, committed code more frequently, and passed more unit tests. The students found the Leaderboard to be motivating and passing unit tests was exciting for them.},

  title={Play With One’s Feelings: A Study on Emotion Awareness for Player Experience}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={14},
  number={1},
  pages={3-12},
  abstract={Affective interaction between players of video games can elicit rich and varying patterns of emotions. In multiplayer activities that take place in a common space (such as sports and board games), players are generally aware of the emotions of their teammates or opponents as they can directly observe their behavioral patterns, facial expressions, head pose, body stance, and so on. Players of online video games, however, are not generally aware of the other players’ emotions given the limited channels of direct interaction among them (e.g., via emojis or chat boxes). It also turns out that the impact of real-time emotion-awareness on play is still unexplored in the space of online digital games. Motivated by this lack of empirical knowledge on the role of the affect of others to one’s gameplay performance, in this article, we investigate the degrees to which the expression of manifested emotions of an opponent can affect the emotions of the player and consequently his gameplay behavior. In this initial study, we test our hypothesis on a two-player adversarial car racing game. We perform a comprehensive user study to evaluate the emotions, behaviors, and attitudes of players in emotion aware versus emotion agnostic game versions. Our findings suggest that expressing the emotional state of the opponent through an emoji in real-time affects the emotional state and behavior of players that can consequently affect their playing experience.},

  abstract={The use of virtual-reality technology in the areas of rehabilitation and therapy continues to grow, with encouraging results being reported for applications that address human physical, cognitive, and psychological functioning. This article presents a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis for the field of VR rehabilitation and therapy. The SWOT analysis is a commonly employed framework in the business world for analyzing the factors that influence a company's competitive position in the marketplace with an eye to the future. However, the SWOT framework can also be usefully applied outside of the pure business domain. A quick check on the Internet will turn up SWOT analyses for urban-renewal projects, career planning, website design, youth sports programs, and evaluation of academic research centers, and it becomes obvious that it can be usefully applied to assess and guide any organized human endeavor designed to accomplish a mission. It is hoped that this structured examination of the factors relevant to the current and future status of VR rehabilitation will provide a good overview of the key issues and concerns that are relevant for understanding and advancing this vital application area.},

  abstract={Focused attention has great impact on our quality of life. Our learning, social skills and even happiness are closely intertwined with our capacity for focused attention. Attention promotion is replete with examples of training-induced increases in attention capability, most of which rely on visual and auditory stimulation. Pure haptic stimulation to increase attention capability is rarely found. We show that accurate force control tasks with pure haptic feedback enhance short-term focused attention. Participants were trained by a force control task in which information from visual and auditory channels was blocked, and only haptic feedback was provided. The trainees were asked to exert a target force within a pre-defined force tolerance for a specific duration. The tolerance was adaptively modified to different levels of difficulty to elicit full participant engagement. Three attention tests showed significant changes in different aspects of focused attention in participants who had been trained as compared with those who had not, thereby illustrating the role of haptic-based sensory-motor tasks in the promotion of short-term focused attention. The findings highlight the potential value of haptic stimuli in brain plasticity and serve as a new tool to extend existing computer games for cognitive enhancement.},

  volume={11},

  pages={121-128},
  abstract={User modeling is an important area in the field of artificial intelligence. Traditionally, user modeling approaches have focused on individual features of users, leaving aside aspects of users as part of a group. However, in enterprise, academic, or political contexts, it is common to find groups of people working together to solve a collaborative task using online collaborative platforms. In this context, counting with a knowledge based on describing the users' behavior when working in a group (i.e., the collaborative profile) is vital for a system aiming at assisting them to enhance their collaborative abilities that might impact the group dynamics. Traditionally, collaborative abilities have been measured by means of questionnaires or by an external human observer. In this work, we propose an approach to build collaborative profiles by the means of observation of users' behavior in a collaborative serious game. The main advantage of our approach is that it avoids external human observers of the group dynamics and the use of self-perception questionnaires. We obtained promising results when comparing the user profiles obtained with our approach with respect to the classical measurement instruments.},

This study evaluates a novel biofeedback holographic game, EtherealBreathing, designed to support autistic children. In EtherealBreathing, children practice box breathing to collect virtual elements to maintain the Earth's balance, using a wearable sensor to measure chest expansion for breath detection. A deployment study with 20 autistic children revealed that EtherealBreathing effectively promotes box breathing, leading to better health-related outcomes, such as lowering participants’ heart and respiratory rates than traditional practices. Biofeedback games can be effective in the healthcare domain, reducing stress-related physiological variables like heart and respiratory rate.},

  year={2022},

  number={11},
  pages={21944-21958},
  abstract={Though automated vehicles (AVs) are believed to play a crucial role in future transport, human driving vehicles will share the road with automated vehicles for a relatively long period. So, we need to enable automated vehicles to run along with human drivers especially when they may have conflicts in the right of way. One key problem is how to appropriately model human driving behaviors and quickly simulate their actions when training/testing automated vehicles. Many existing models were originally built for traffic flow studies and may not be suitable for automated vehicles studies. In this paper, we propose a set of new principles of human driving behaviors modeling and simulations. Then, we propose a Data-Driven Simulator (D2Sim) model for human behavior learning, description, and vehicle interaction simulation. In contrast to conventional microscopic traffic flow models, the D2Sim is a trajectory generation model that accepts rich driving environment information (e.g., lane geometry, crosswalks, traffic signals, surrounding vehicles, etc.). Different from many empirical trajectory records replay models, we can arbitrarily set the long-term intentions of the simulated vehicles and intentionally design the corner cases that had not been observed in practice. In addition, the D2Sim adopts adversarial learning to comprehend complex yet stochastic human driving behaviors from empirical data. Testing results show that the proposed model can quickly generate high-resolution trajectory data for training and testing.},

  year={2003},
  volume={12},
  number={4},
  pages={422-436},
  abstract={The development of computer-generated synthetic environments, also calleddistributed virtual environments (DVEs), relies heavily upon computer-generated actors (CGAs) to provide accurate behaviors at reasonable cost so that the synthetic environments are useful, affordable, complex, and realistic. Unfortunately, the pace of synthetic environment development and the level of desired CGA performance continue to rise at a much faster rate than CGA capability improvements. This insatiable demand for realism in CGAs for synthetic environments arises from the growing understanding of the significant role that modeling and simulation can play in a variety of uses. These uses include training, analysis, procurement decisions, mission rehearsal, doctrine development, force-level and task-level training, information assurance, cyberwarfare, force structure analysis, sustainability analysis, life cycle costs analysis, material management, infrastructure analysis, and many other uses. In these and other uses of military synthetic environments, computergenerated actors play a central role because they have the potential to increase the realism of the environment while also reducing the cost of operating the environment. The progress made in addressing the technical challenges that must be overcome to realize effective and realistic CGAs for military simulation environments and the technical areas that should be the focus of future work are the subject of this series of papers, which surveys the technologies and progress made in the construction and use of CGAs. In this, the second installment of three papers in the series, we present a discussion of CGA software architectures and a discussion of approaches to human behavior modeling.},

  pages={1481-1487},
  abstract={Hemiparesis resulting from a stroke has a direct impact on patients' daily activities. New approaches for motor rehabilitation include Serious Games (SG) because they include (in a motivating way) the three fundamental elements for rehabilitation: intensive, repetitive and task-oriented training. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic effects of a biomedical SG and a scoring system developed for lower limb motor rehabilitation of hemiparetic stroke patients. The SG was inspired by the classic videogame called Pong, where the goal is to control a tennis racquet, but using muscular strength. A knee extensor apparatus was adapted with a load cell and mechanical adjustments for measuring the muscular strength of the quadriceps femoris (QFG) and hamstrings (HSG). A scoring system was proposed to evaluate muscular control. Eleven hemiparetic stroke patients participated in an exercise program using the SG twice a week for ten weeks and only the paretic side was trained. Significant Effect Sizes (d) were found for QFG strength (d = 0.5; p = 0.021), QFG control (d = 1.1; p <; 0.001), HSG strength (d = 1.1; p = 0.001), HSG control (d = 1.5; p = 0.003), functional mobility (d = 0.3; p <; 0.001), gait speed (d = 0.4; p = 0.007) and motor recovery (d = 1.0; p <; 0.001). Results indicate that the intervention of a SG with both proper apparatus and evaluation system may effectively promote lower limb motor rehabilitation of hemiparetic stroke patients.},

  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={108407-108417},
  abstract={This paper presents a wearable motion capture (MoCap)-based serious game (SG) for physical rehabilitation and evaluates its user experience. Conventional physical rehabilitation relies on professional trainers, equipment, and facilities, which are time-consuming and expensive for users. It often reduces the users’ motivation to perform exercises. It can be difficult for users to continue their physical rehabilitation through the conventional model. However, recent studies demonstrate that serious games have the potential to improve the effectiveness of rehabilitation training through a more engaged and immersive game design. Most of those studies focus on technology and the development of a specific MoCap sensor-based SG design for users with motor deficiencies, rather than emphasizing the users’ experience impacting the effect of performance in physical rehabilitation. This study developed a prototype of a physical rehabilitation exercise game that considers user experience. This game employs a wearable inertial MoCap sensor enabling users to interact intuitively with the game to promote physical activities for health. We analyze and discuss user satisfaction and game experience through user experience questionnaires. The results suggest that most users were satisfied with the SG-based rehabilitation, and found the game was enjoyable and engaging. Based on the implications, we discuss possible future research to improve user experience of the highly accurate real-time MoCap-based serious game. This can enable users with motor disabilities to undertake physical exercises in a home environment.},

  abstract={Influence operations in cyberspace have raised questions about how narratives are strategically disseminated and circulated online, and in particular, whether state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) techniques for narrative understanding and automated narrative generation are or will soon become part of adversarial nation-states’ arsenal. However, until we clarify some fundamental ambiguities surrounding narratives in cyberspace, we cannot accurately assess the threat of ML. For instance, how do we define “narrative” in a way that makes sense across all the various organizations and academic disciplines that must be involved in defending against disinformation? What blind spots in our shared lexicon have stymied the United States’ response to disinformation attacks so far? This paper aims to take a step towards alleviating the confusion by analyzing the usage of some common terminology, summarizing some recent contributions in the realm of disinformation, positing a new systems-dynamic model of narrative in cyberspace, and demonstrating the use of the model in the context of an existing case study in disinformation.},

  abstract={This paper presents Comme il Faut (CiF), an artificial intelligence system that matches character performances to appropriate social context, with the goal of enabling authors to write high-level rules governing expected character behavior in given social situations, rather than specific fixed choice points in a curated narrative structure. CiF models characters with a complex set of traits, feelings, and relationships, who can form intents, take actions, relate to a shared cultural space, and remember and refer to past events. A set of authored rules encoding appropriate behavior within a specific story world allow these characters to select actions to take (and respond to actions by others) in a manner consistent with their own personal and social concerns as well as a shifting interpersonal context. Through the development and release of Prom Week, a complete game using CiF as its narrative engine, we show how the system successfully creates complex narratives that are unique for each player and directed by those players' attempts to make progress towards story goals. We also show how CiF continues to be used in several in-progress interactive experiences (Mismanor and IMMERSE), speaking to the utility and flexibility of its design.},

  pages={302-311},
  abstract={We present a new diffeomorphic surface mapping algorithm under the framework of large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM). Unlike existing LDDMM approaches, this new algorithm reduces the complexity of the estimation of diffeomorphic transformations by incorporating a shape prior in which a nonlinear diffeomorphic shape space is represented by a linear space of initial momenta of diffeomorphic geodesic flows from a fixed template. In addition, for the first time, the diffeomorphic mapping is formulated within a decision-theoretic scheme based on Bayesian modeling in which an empirical shape prior is characterized by a low dimensional Gaussian distribution on initial momentum. This is achieved using principal component analysis (PCA) to construct the eigenspace of the initial momentum. A likelihood function is formulated as the conditional probability of observing surfaces given any particular value of the initial momentum, which is modeled as a random field of vector-valued measures characterizing the geometry of surfaces. We define the diffeomorphic mapping as a problem that maximizes a posterior distribution of the initial momentum given observable surfaces over the eigenspace of the initial momentum. We demonstrate the stability of the initial momentum eigenspace when altering training samples using a bootstrapping method. We then validate the mapping accuracy and show robustness to outliers whose shape variation is not incorporated into the shape prior.},

  abstract={We propose a new high dimensional semiparametric principal component analysis (PCA) method, named Copula Component Analysis (COCA). The semiparametric model assumes that, after unspecified marginally monotone transformations, the distributions are multivariate Gaussian. COCA improves upon PCA and sparse PCA in three aspects: (i) It is robust to modeling assumptions; (ii) It is robust to outliers and data contamination; (iii) It is scale-invariant and yields more interpretable results. We prove that the COCA estimators obtain fast estimation rates and are feature selection consistent when the dimension is nearly exponentially large relative to the sample size. Careful experiments confirm that COCA outperforms sparse PCA on both synthetic and real-world data sets.},

  pages={1092-1099},
  abstract={Motor preparation and execution require the interactions of a large-scale brain network, while the study of the dynamic changes of their interactions could uncover the underlying neural mechanism of the corresponding information processing. This dynamic analysis requires high temporal resolution of the recorded signals. Electroencephalogram (EEG) with high temporal resolution has been widely used in related studies. However, studies based on scalp EEG always lead to distorted results, due to scalp volume conduction, compared with that of cortically recorded signals. In the current study, the dynamic networks of motor preparation and execution are investigated using Go/No-go tasks performed with the left/right hand. In the analysis, the EEG source localization and dynamic causal model are combined together to investigate the neural processes of motor preparation and execution. The results show that similar network patterns with nodes distributed in the bilateral occipital lobe, bilateral temporal lobe, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and contralateral supplementary motor area could be revealed for both the Go and No-go tasks. Statistical testing further indicates that stronger couplings with the supplementary motor area could be found in Go and right-hand response tasks compared with No-go and left-hand response tasks, respectively. The findings in the current study demonstrate that the information exchange within the motor related brain networks plays an important role for motor related functions, i.e., the different motor functions may have the different information exchange and processing network patterns.},

  abstract={Much current research in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) employs multivariate machine learning approaches (e.g., support vector machines) to detect distributed spatial patterns from the temporal fluctuations of the neural signal. The aim of many studies is not classification, however, but investigation of multivariate spatial patterns, which pattern classifiers detect only indirectly. Here we propose a direct statistical measure for the existence of distributed spatial patterns (or spatial heterogeneity) applicable to fMRI datasets. We extend the univariate general linear model (GLM), typically used in fMRI analysis, to a multivariate case. We demonstrate that contrasting maximum likelihood estimations of different restrictions on this multivariate model can be used to estimate the extent of spatial heterogeneity in fMRI data. Under asymptotic assumptions inference can be made with reference to the χ2 distribution. The test statistic is then assessed using simulated timecourses derived from real fMRI data followed by analyzing data from a real fMRI experiment. These analyses demonstrate the utility of the proposed measure of heterogeneity as well as considerations in its application. Measuring spatial heterogeneity in fMRI has important theoretical implications in its own right and may have potential uses for better characterising neurological conditions such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) skills are becoming increasingly relevant for future professionals across all domains, beyond computer science (CS). As such, an increasing number of bachelor's and master's programs outside of the CS discipline integrate CT courses within their study program. At the same time, tools such as notebooks and interactive apps designed to support the teaching of programming concepts are becoming ever more popular. However, in non-CS majors, CT might not be perceived as essential, and students might lack the motivation to engage with such tools in order to acquire solid CT skills. This article presents a field study conducted with 115 students during a full semester on a novel computational notebook environment. It evaluates computational notebooks and CT skills in an introductory course on information technology for first-year undergraduates in business and economics. A multidimensional evaluation approach makes use of pre- and post-test surveys, lectures, and self-directed laboratory sessions tracking analytics. Our findings suggest that, in the process of learning CT for non-CS students, engagement in active learning activities can be a stronger determinant of learning outcomes than initial knowledge. Furthermore, gamifying computational notebooks can serve as a strong driver of active learning engagement, even more so than initial motivational factors.},

  abstract={Humans tendency to engage in behaviors that are harmful to themselves, the environment, and the society has always been present on a personal and collective level. However, the concern for this kind of phenomena is increasing, as demographic and economic growth is amplifying its impact on people health, economies, and ecosystems. As a consequence, we have seen the rise of research fields as design for behavior change, with a growing interest in the use of tools as persuasive technologies, serious games and interactive systems to affect people awareness, attitude, and behavior. To these purposes, computer graphics and especially virtual reality (VR) has great potential since it can provide experiences to deepen users’ understanding and emotional involvement regarding a variety of social and environmental issues. Here, we discuss the use of VR as a powerful, versatile, and cost-effective tool to deliver virtual experiences that inform and motivate users to change behavior. We describe and relate different aspects regarding sustainable behavior and VR experience design with respect to their potential to support behavior change.},

  abstract={Crowd evacuation in emergencies may lead to fatalities if the evacuation plans were not tested and evaluated. Traditionally, evacuation drills have been, and still are, being used to assess evacuation plans. However, in recent years the simulation of evacuation plans during emergencies has emerged as a strong alternative that is cost effective and potentially more accurate. Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) is the preferred type of simulation for evacuation scenarios, due to its ability to model individual decision-making and social behaviour. In this paper we conduct meta-analysis of eighty-one peer-reviewed papers published between 2009 and 2019 that used ABS to model pedestrian evacuation. Our analysis assesses the current state-of-art and identifies opportunities for improvement. We identify seven dimensions over which the surveyed papers agree or differ. The dimensions include purpose of the simulation, type of emergency and environment considerations, type and scale of evacuated space, simulation software used, agents' characteristics and behaviour, support of evacuation policies, and analysis and validation. We conduct meta-analysis of the surveyed papers along the identified dimensions. One of the main findings of our analysis is the lack of a standardized validation methodology for ABS of emergency evacuation.},

  abstract={Digitalization has transformed businesses, especially during the ongoing pandemic. Firms have gradually moved to digital ecosystems and e-marketplaces. Digital transformation (DT) has helped firms improve profit margins, better engage customers, improve productivity, and reduce any functional and operational lags. While some firms have strategically transformed themselves in the digital space, others have adopted technology in an unstructured way. As a result, these firms’ employees have been exposed to sets of new technologies. While some have adopted them based on their past experience, others have perceived them as challenges and have resisted change. This brings us to an important question of whether the DT is inclusive. In this article, the hedonic motivation system adoption model (HMSAM) and flow theory were used to investigate the inclusivity of DT and to propose a modified HMSAM model. As part of in their respective firms’ DT process, employees are exposed to a gamified environment. This article collected data from retail sector employees based in an emerging nation and tested hypotheses using structured equation modeling.},

  abstract={Contribution: This article analyzes the learning and motivational impact of teacher-authored educational video games on computer science education and compares its effectiveness in both face-to-face and online (remote) formats. This work presents comparative data and findings obtained from 217 students who played the game in a face-to-face format (control group) and 104 students who played the game in an online format (experimental group). Background: Serious video games have been proven effective at computer science education, however, it is still unknown whether the effectiveness of these games is the same regardless of their format, face-to-face or online. Moreover, the usage of games created through authoring tools has barely been explored. Research Questions: Are teacher-authored educational video games effective in terms of learning and motivation for computer science students? Does the effectiveness of teacher-authored educational video games depend on whether they are used in a face-to-face or online format? Methodology: A quasi-experiment has been conducted by using three instruments (pre-test, post-test, and questionnaire) with the purpose of comparing the effectiveness of game-based learning in face-to-face and online formats. A total of 321 computer science students played a teacher-authored educational video game aimed to learn about software design. Findings: The results reveal that teacher-authored educational video games are highly effective in terms of knowledge acquisition and motivation both in face-to-face and online formats. The results also show that some students’ perceptions were more positive when a face-to-face format was used.},

Key themes include the transformative impact of VR on education through improved motivation and experiential learning, therapeutic applications addressing physical and mental health, and professional training in hazardous and high-skill environments. Despite their potential, adoption is hindered by challenges such as high costs, limited accessibility, ethical concerns, and technical limitations, including cybersickness and scalability issues. This review also highlights emerging trends, including AI-driven adaptive learning, advancements in haptic feedback, and the integration of multisensory experiences, offering opportunities to address these barriers.

Our paper describes the virtual world implementation of autonomous opportunistic agents learning in a dynamically changing environment, creating abstract goals, and taking advantage of arising opportunities to improve their performance. An opportunistic agent achieves better results than an agent based on ML only. It does so by minimizing the average value of all need signals rather than a dominating need.

  abstract={The evacuation efficiency of building plans is of obvious importance to the public safety. The complexity of building plans, however, makes it difficult for the efficiency evaluation. This paper presents a computational model AutoEscape, which can simulate the evacuation process for any given occupant distribution in buildings. Designed as an extensible multi-level structure, the model constructs the geometry level and occupant level and establishes the interactions between levels. The GIS-based environmental analysis is realized to automatically generate the geometric representation and formulate the cognition of agents. The multi-agent based technology is employed to simulate the crowd behaviors with autonomously acting individuals. A visualization component, which provides 3D free observations for the simulation process, is developed on the platform of OGRE and integrated into the system interface in form of ActiveX control. Finally, a case study has been conducted and the results have been compared with the results of an existing model to show the reliability and capacity of AutoEscape simulation.},

  pages={2377-2395},
  abstract={Behavior selection is typically a "built-in" feature of behavior-based architectures and hence, not amenable to change. There are, however, circumstances where changing behavior selection strategies is useful and can lead to better performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that such dynamic changes of behavior selection mechanisms are beneficial in several circumstances. We first categorize existing behavior selection mechanisms along three dimensions and then discuss seven possible circumstances where dynamically switching among them can be beneficial. Using the agent architecture framework activation, priority, observer, and component (APOC), we show how instances of all (nonempty) categories can be captured and how additional architectural mechanisms can be added to allow for dynamic switching among them. In particular, we propose a generic architecture for dynamic behavior selection, which can integrate existing behavior selection mechanisms in a unified way. Based on this generic architecture, we then verify that dynamic behavior selection is beneficial in the seven cases by defining architectures for simulated and robotic agents and performing experiments with them. The quantitative and qualitative analyzes of the results obtained from extensive simulation studies and experimental runs with robots verify the utility of the proposed mechanisms.},

  abstract={We developed a three-dimensional (3D) digitized atlas of the human brain to visualize spatially complex structures. It was designed for use with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging data sets. Thus far, we have used this atlas for surgical planning, model-driven segmentation, and teaching. We used a combination of automated and supervised segmentation methods to define regions of interest based on neuroanatomical knowledge. We also used 3D surface rendering techniques to create a brain atlas that would allow us to visualize complex 3D brain structures. We further linked this Information to script files in order to preserve both spatial information and neuroanatomical knowledge. We present here the application of the atlas for visualization in surgical planning far model-driven segmentation and for the teaching of neuroanatomy. This digitized human brain has the potential to provide important reference information for the planning of surgical procedures. It can also serve as a powerful teaching tool, since spatial relationships among neuroanatomical structures can be more readily envisioned when the user is able to view and rotate the structures in 3D space. Moreover, each element of the brain atlas is associated with a name tag, displayed by a user controlled pointer. The atlas holds a major promise as a template for model-driven segmentation. Using this technique, many regions of interest can be characterized simultaneously on new brain images.},

  abstract={Higher education in Spain has to deal with constant troubles and uncertainties due to the economic crisis, high rates of unemployment in young people, lack for study habits in secondary school and legal fluctuations. This uncertain environment does not foster student effort and it is behind the important rates of abandon in higher education. The Bologna Process was thought to create a new paradigm in higher education in the European Union. However, the changes came from the top (governments) to the bottom (lectures and students) so they were not properly supported by specialized training oriented to lecturers. It did not include the appropriate changes in lower education stages (secondary education) to prepare student when facing University. Therefore, in the past decade several new teaching methodologies have appeared to deal with student demotivation and to fight against dropouts. Those methodologies try to keep the students engaged during the whole course paying more attention to their learning process, attitudes, motivations and expectations. Consequently, in this paper, we present a four-year experiment whose main objective is to keep students engaged during the whole year and to foster their motivation in order to increase their learning outcomes. The experiment is based on the application of gamification to the assessment process emulating a traditional platform video-game, like Super Mario. The results show that this experiment was positive for most students who achieved good marks and good rates of task completion.},

  abstract={Previous research on game-based learning has provided firm empirical evidence that playing educational video games can positively impact students’ motivation and learning outcomes at all levels of education and disciplines. However, the use and uptake of game-based learning in educational settings is being hampered by the lack of authoring tools capable of allowing teachers to easily create educational video games and adapt them according to their needs and contexts of use. Moreover, in order to determine to which extent this kind of tools are useful for teachers to conduct effective game-based learning experiences, further research is required to evaluate these tools from the teachers’ perspective, as well as to evaluate the instructional effectiveness of the educational video games that teachers can create by using them. This article contributes to fill this research gap by presenting a teacher-oriented authoring tool for educational games called SGAME, as well as by examining the teachers’ perceptions toward this tool and the effect of the educational video games it allows to create on students’ perceptions and learning outcomes. A total of three evaluation instruments were used: a questionnaire to collect teachers’ perceptions toward the SGAME authoring tool, another questionnaire to collect students’ perceptions toward a game created with SGAME, and a pre-test and a post-test to measure the students’ learning gains achieved by playing this game. A total of 201 teachers and 79 students participated in the evaluation reported in this article. The results of this article show that SGAME is an easy-to-use authoring tool that allows teachers to create motivating and effective educational video games.},

  abstract={It has been emphasized for a long time that real-world applications of developmental robots require lifelong and online learning. A major challenge in this field is the high sample-complexity of algorithms, which has led to the development of intrinsic motivation approaches to render learning more efficient. However, only few works have been demonstrated on real robots and although these robots are supposed to share the environment with humans, there is hardly any research to integrate intrinsic motivation with learning from an interacting teacher. In this article, we tackle the efficiency challenge by proposing a novel extrinsic–intrinsic motivation learning scheme. We specifically investigate how to combine intrinsic motivation with learning from observation to accelerate learning. Our novel scheme comprises four elements: 1) a probabilistic intrinsic motivation signal yielding the robot’s interest; 2) a probabilistic extrinsic motivation signal to expand the robot’s knowledge by learning from observation; 3) novelty detection; and 4) novelty degree methods to enable the robot to decide autonomously how and when to explore. The efficiency as well as the applicability of our methods are benchmarked in simulation experiments and demonstrated on a physical 7-degree of freedom left arm of Baxter robot.},

  year={2024},
  volume={67},
  number={1},
  pages={131-142},
  abstract={Contribution: A successful activity based on the scavenger hunt (SH) game is presented here. Although “serious game” in education now seems synonymous with videogame, the effectiveness of hands-on traditional games to increase student performance that, besides, they also like is defended and proved. The proposal is not focused, as is usual, on a single aspect of the educational environment, but on integrating behavioral and affective aspects into the learning process. Background: The literature analysis shows the predominance of serious games based on videogames in education, perhaps due to the lack of objective evidence concerning the influence of traditional game alternatives, such as SHs, on students’ attitude/learning. This objective evidence is addressed with a proposal to motivate and integrate the students, making them more participative and thus positively affect their learning. Intended Outcomes: The activity increases motivation (behavioral outcome) and socialization (affective outcome), boosting learning (competence outcome); besides, students like the activity. Application Design: The necessity for a different instructional strategy came from the lack of commitment by the students in the first year of Computer Science Engineering. So a game (they are entertaining and powerful tools to increase motivation) that takes the students outside their normal working environment (classroom and laboratory) was designed. The study follows a cross sectional design with experimental and control sets randomly created, and sizes of 106 and 98 students, respectively. Findings: Highly satisfactory and statistically significant results were achieved: their attitude in class and personal study was more active (motivation), new relationships were created (socialization), they obtained better marks (learning) and enjoyed the activity (user experience), even though it was nondigital.},

In this study, we used a distributional analysis approach to investigate the properties of content word production during discourse by 46 participants spanning a wide range of chronic poststroke aphasia and 20 neurotypical adults, using different stimuli that elicited three discourse genres (descriptive, narrative, and procedural). Initially, we inspected the discourse data with respect to the quantity of production, lexical–semantic diversity, and psycholinguistic features (frequency and imageability) of content words. Subsequently, we created a “lexical–semantic landscape,” which is sensitive to subtle changes and allowed us to evaluate the pattern of changes in discourse production across groups. Relative to neurotypical adults, all persons with aphasia (both fluent and nonfluent) showed significant reduction in the quantity and diversity of production, but the lexical–semantic complexity of word production directly mirrored neurotypical performance. Specifically, persons with aphasia produced the same rate of nouns/verbs, and their discourse samples covered the full range of word frequency and imageability, albeit with reduced word quantity. These findings provide novel evidence that, unlike in other disorders (e.g., semantic dementia), discourse production in poststroke aphasia has relatively preserved lexical–semantic complexity but demonstrates significantly compromised quantity of content word production. Voxel-wise lesion-symptom mapping using both univariate and multivariate approaches revealed left frontal regions particularly the pars opercularis, insular cortex, and central and frontal opercular cortices supporting word retrieval during connected speech, irrespective of their word class or lexical–semantic complexity.},

  abstract={Who said that violent video games cannot promote calm behavior? Could we reverse engineer the difficulty system of a horror game to encourage the player to stay calm as opposed to feeling under constant pressure? To explore the feasibility of the approach and its effectiveness, we created a horror game, Caroline, which uses the player’s biometric data to adapt the difficulty of the game: if the player is too stressed, the difficulty increases, and the opposite happens if the player is relaxed. We explored the effect of such an approach on players’ cognitive, emotional, performative, and decision-making challenge as well as their intrinsic motivation by comparing it to the base game without any dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA). Our results showed that players felt more motivated when the gameplay was adjusted according to their heart rate. However, out of the four types of challenge, the only one affected by the DDA was the decision-making challenge. We discuss what these findings mean for video game design and research into affective computing and provide suggestions for future research.},

  year={2020},
  volume={8},

  pages={219632-219655},
  abstract={Consumers lie at the epicenter of smart grids, since their activities account for a large portion of the total energy demand. Therefore, utility companies, governmental agencies, and various other entities with environmental concerns aim at lowering and shaping energy consumption patterns to achieve peak load reduction, load smoothing, and hence carbon emission curtailment. In this survey paper, we present an overview of approaches for engaging smart grid consumers and for providing them with information, motivation, and recommendations for energy efficiency through mobile apps. Our focus is to bring machine learning approaches closer to smart grid mobile apps so as to optimally manage consumer flexibility and enhance energy savings through detailed consumer profiling and modeling, since an increasing amount of energy consumer data is becoming available. A novel survey and analysis of prior work in the area is conducted in order to identify gaps from this perspective. We consider both recent research project outputs and commercial products and we discuss various aspects of the designs, such as state-of-the-art technologies, extrinsic and intrinsic motivation techniques, gamification, consumer profiling, and the role of machine learning and recommender systems in this context. Furthermore, different mobile apps are presented and compared based on the most important features that affect consumer energy efficiency and sustainability, such as data visualization, gamification, flexibility, consumer profiling methods, feedback mechanisms, recommendations, social media, and machine learning integration. The main goal of this work is to identify how mobile apps incorporate these features to engage energy consumers in energy-efficient behavior, assess the current state-of-the-art in the area, and highlight future research directions.},

  abstract={The objective of the research is to assess the impact of using the Classcraft gamification platform to promote collaborative work among students in Regular Basic Education. The selected population consisted of 200 third-grade high school students, with the experimental sample comprising 30 students selected through non-probabilistic convenience sampling, based on inclusion criteria such as technological skills and tool management. The activities developed detail learning sessions designed to develop various aspects of collaborative work using the Classcraft gamification platform. The data collection instrument includes a questionnaire divided into 5 dimensions: Positive interdependence, task interdependence, individual and group responsibility, interpersonal and small group skills, and internal team management. Each dimension contains items rated on a scale from 1 to 5. The pretest results showed that the majority of students had a regular level of collaborative work. However, in the posttest, a significant increase in the “Good” level was observed, indicating effective development of collaborative work following the intervention with the Classcraft platform. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that the use of the Classcraft gamification platform had a positive impact on the development of collaborative work in high school students. The results suggest that the implementation of this platform contributed to strengthening internal team management skills and collaborative learning, improving interdependence, and individual and group responsibility among students. These findings support the initial hypothesis and underscore the importance of gamification in the educational context for promoting effective collaboration among students.},

  abstract={Abstract Of the many concepts of user experience (UX), only a few address UX in the work domain. In addition, while most underline the dynamic nature of UX, not many studies take an explicit longitudinal approach. This article presents data about how the UX of work-related interactive systems changed over the course of 13 weeks. Specifically, we studied the change in four groups of behaviors—execute, evolve, expand and engage—which we deem important for goal achievement. We examined the impact of user attributes (playfulness, computer expertise) as well as product attributes (pragmatic quality, hedonic quality). Multilevel analysis (MLA) provided the methodological frame for the statistical analysis. Since MLA is rather uncommon in human–computer interaction, we thoroughly discuss it and clarify its advantages over repeated-measures analysis of variance. Our study verified that time is an important predictor, confirming that UX (i.e. particular goal achievement-related behaviors and the perception of product attributes) changes over time. The pattern of change differed among participants in terms of rate and direction of change, and those differences even increased over the course of our study. Product attributes influenced change considerably, while playfulness had an impact on engaging behavior in the sense that more playful participants lost interest even faster.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence in games is typically used for creating player's opponents. Manual editing of intelligent behaviors for nonplayer characters (NPCs) of games is a cumbersome task that needs experienced designers. Our research aims to assist designers in this task. Behaviors typically use recurring patterns, so that experience and reuse are crucial aspects for behavior design. The use of hierarchical structures like hierarchical state machines, behavior trees (BTs), or hierarchical task networks, allows working on different abstraction levels reusing pieces from the more detailed levels. However, the static nature of the design process does not release the designer from the burden of completely specifying each behavior. Our approach applies case-based reasoning (CBR) techniques to retrieve and reuse stored behaviors represented as BTs. In this paper, we focus on dynamic retrieval and selection of behaviors taking into account the world state and the underlying goals. The global behavior of the NPC is dynamically built at runtime querying the CBR system. We exemplify our approach through a serious game, developed by our research group, with gameplay elements from first-person shooter (FPS) games.},

  abstract={Childhood obesity is becoming one of the 21st century's most important public health problems. Nowadays, the main treatment of childhood obesity is behavior intervention that aims at improve children's lifestyle to arrest the disease. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have not been widely employed in this intervention, and most of existing ICTs systems are not having a long-term effect. The purpose of this paper is to define a system to support family-based intervention through a state-of-the-art analysis of family-based interventions and related technological solutions first, and then using the analytic hierarchy process to derive a childhood obesity family-based behavior intervention model, and finally to provide a prototype of a system called OB CITY. The system makes use of applied behavior analysis, affective computing technologies, as well as serious game and gamification techniques, to offer long term services in all care dimensions of the family-based behavioral intervention aiming to provide positive effects to the treatment of childhood obesity.},

  pages={26-36},
  abstract={In the recent Smart Home (SH) research work, intelligent service recommendation technique based on behavior recognition, it has been extensively preferred by researchers. However, most current research uses the Semantic recognition to construct the user's basic behavior model. This method is usually restricted by environmental factors, the way these models are built makes it impossible for them to dynamically match the services that might be provided in the user environment. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a Semantic behavior assistance (Semantic behavior assistance, SBA). By joining the semantic model on the intelligent gateway, building an SA model, in this way, a logical Internet networks for smart home is established. At the same time, a behavior assistant method based on SBA model is proposed, among them, the user environment-related entities, sensors, devices, and user-related knowledge models exist in the logical interconnection network of the SH system through the semantic model. In this paper, the data simulation experiment is carried out on the method. The experimental results show that the SBA model is better than the knowledge-based pre-defined model.},

  abstract={In the last years, many didactic activities have been proposed to develop Computational Thinking (CT) skills in children and adolescents. Among these activities, the digital game programming stands out as a promising alternative considering that it is related to a familiar and motivating context for students. These initiatives are not specifically aimed at individuals with special needs such as the autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Children and adolescents with ASD usually have some limitations related to communication, cognitive flexibility, and interpersonal relationships. However, it seems natural that the skills potentially developed through game programming activities are especially beneficial for the public with ASD. In this paper, we describe the offering and evaluation of a Game Building Workshop adapted to adolescents with this condition. The guidelines used to define the workshop activities are described. An assessment based on the classroom observation and analysis of produced artifacts indicate that the participants acquired CT skills related to programming at a high level. In addition, the collaborative nature of the activities offered a stimulating and welcoming environment for individuals with ASD.},

  abstract={Games for change is a growing research field and studies have shown that these games can promote positive behavior change using various persuasive strategies.

Our analysis reveals the reward strategy is the most popular persuasive strategy employed in the persuasive games’ research. We also uncovered that, even though persuasive games have been strongly effective at promoting behavior change, there was a significant negative relationship between the number of persuasive strategies employed in persuasive games and their overall effectiveness. Based on these findings, we provide insights and design suggestions, operationalization, and assessment for persuasive games.},

  abstract={To enhance the machines’ intelligence, it is important for them to learn how humans perform tasks. In this article, the issue of online adaptive learning human behavior is addressed for a class of human-in-the-loop (HiTL) systems using the state measurement only. The hypothesis underlying our study is that human behavior can be described by a linear quadratic optimal control model with an unknown weighting matrix for the quadratic cost function. In this model, the weighting matrix depicts the human tradeoff of various objectives. Our aim is thus to only use the system state measurement for learning the weighting matrix under the condition that human feedback gain matrix is unknown. A novel adaptive inverse optimal control approach to online learning human behavior is proposed for the HiTL system, which integrates adaptive estimation and linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization techniques. Our approach consists of two steps: First, an adaptive law is developed to learn the human feedback gain matrix online using the system state measurement only, and second, the weighting matrix of human cost function is retrieved by solving an LMI optimization problem with the learned feedback gain matrix. Finally, simulation and experiment results on a steering assist system of intelligent vehicles are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  year={2023},
  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={124975-124984},
  abstract={Purpose: Lingual exercises based on tongue movements are common in speech therapy. These exercises can be tedious for patients, but gamification and virtual reality (VR) with head-mounted displays (HMD) can serve as effective strategies to enhance their motivation and engagement. However, the use of these technologies can be challenging for therapists due to a lack of technological skills. Material and Methods: A new system to support HMD-based VR for gamified tongue rehabilitation exercises is proposed. The system offers a variety of games that challenge users to achieve their goals through tongue movements and sound interaction. These games support different interaction actions that can be set by therapists using easy-to-use editors. The system also provide functionalities for patient follow-up. The system has been implemented and tested considering different technologies such as mobile devices, personal computers, and HMD complemented with an external camera to properly capture the tongue movements. Results: The therapists found the system to be user-friendly, requiring no additional support for effective utilization. The system’s versatility allows it to be used on mobile devices, as well as with augmented and virtual reality techniques, resulting in more engaging rehabilitation sessions. However, the sensibility of device movements to face detection strategies is a limiting factor of this configuration. In the case of using personal computers with HMD, better results are obtained and especially when virtual reality is considered. In this last case, it is better to consider illuminated scenarios to ensure the proper detection of facial movements. Conclusion: HMD-based VR for gamified tongue rehabilitation with ease to use editors to prepare sessions is a good strategy to improve patient engagement in tongue rehabilitation sessions.},

Our findings suggest that immersive VR improves simulation outcomes, such as increasing learning gain and knowledge retention and improving clinical outcomes for rehabilitation. However, it also has limitations such as motion sickness and restricted access to VR hardware. Our contributions are to provide a better understanding of the benefits and limitations of using VR in immersive simulations with serious purposes, to propose a taxonomy that classifies them, and to discuss whether methods and participants profiles influence results.},

  abstract={In recent times, the use of serious games has significantly advanced in science education, with notable contributions in the design and implementation of game mechanics in immersive environments. This research aims to assess the usability and experience of the serious game ABCCI, identifying both the positive and negative effects generated by its interaction from the perspective of pre-service teachers, considering levels of competence, immersion, tension, flow, and challenge. To evaluate usability, the System Usability Scale (SUS) was adapted, and the Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ) was used to assess the overall experience. The results indicate a moderate positive correlation between the experience and usability of the serious game. Most pre-service teachers expressed positive views about the frequent use of the ABCCI serious game in science education, which successfully created an engaging and positive experience characterized by a sense of competence, immersion, and positive emotions, with an appropriate level of challenge and low levels of negative affect. Further studies are needed to develop a framework for designing games in science education. ABCCI proves to be a promising tool for managing learning.},

  pages={2358-2368},
  abstract={Both local discourse and world knowledge are known to influence sentence processing. We investigated how these two sources of information conspire in language comprehension. Two types of critical sentences, correct and world knowledge anomalies, were preceded by either a neutral or a local context. The latter made the world knowledge anomalies more acceptable or plausible. We predicted that the effect of world knowledge anomalies would be weaker for the local context. World knowledge effects have previously been observed in the left inferior frontal region (Brodmann's area 45/47). In the current study, an effect of world knowledge was present in this region in the neutral context. We also observed an effect in the right inferior frontal gyrus, which was more sensitive to the discourse manipulation than the left inferior frontal gyrus. In addition, the left angular gyrus reacted strongly to the degree of discourse coherence between the context and critical sentence. Overall, both world knowledge and the discourse context affect the process of meaning unification, but do so by recruiting partly different sets of brain areas.},

During a four week training period, recognition of both processed and normal speech in these children continually increased to near age-appropriate levels. The authors conclude that this form of processed speech is subject to profound perceptual learning effects and exhibits widespread generalization to normal speech. This form of learning and generalization contributes to the rehabilitation of temporal processing deficits and language comprehension in this subject population.},

  pages={128-140},
  abstract={It is widely accepted that the difficulty and expense involved in acquiring the knowledge behind tactical behaviors has been one limiting factor in the development of simulated agents representing adversaries and teammates in military and game simulations. Several researchers have addressed this problem with varying degrees of success. The problem mostly lies in the fact that tactical knowledge is difficult to elicit and represent through interactive sessions between the model developer and the subject matter expert. This paper describes a novel approach that employs genetic programming in conjunction with context-based reasoning to evolve tactical agents based upon automatic observation of a human performing a mission on a simulator. In this paper, we describe the process used to carry out the learning. A prototype was built to demonstrate feasibility and it is described herein. The prototype was rigorously and extensively tested. The evolved agents exhibited good fidelity to the observed human performance, as well as the capacity to generalize from it.},

  year={2021},
  volume={26},

  pages={409-430},
  abstract={The possibility of using competitive evolutionary algorithms to generate long-term progress is normally prevented by the convergence on limit cycle dynamics in which the evolving agents keep progressing against their current competitors by periodically rediscovering solutions adopted previously. This leads to local but not to global progress (i.e., progress against all possible competitors). We propose a new competitive algorithm that produces long-term global progress by identifying and filtering out opportunistic variations, that is, variations leading to progress against current competitors and retrogression against other competitors. The efficacy of the method is validated on the coevolution of predator and prey robots, a classic problem that has been used in related researches. The accumulation of global progress over many generations leads to effective solutions that involve the production of articulated behaviors. The complexity of the behavior displayed by the evolving robots increases across generations, although progress in performance is not always accompanied by behavior complexification.},

  abstract={Research on the use of digital games for cancer patients suggests positive impact in the form of the reduction of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and the feeling of nausea after chemotherapy treatment. This can take the childs focus off their condition and their treatment process and direct it toward other aspects of their childhood. In this article, a comprehensive review of the current literature was conducted to assess how serious games could positively impact paediatric cancer patients. Inclusion criteria were used during data extraction to find the most relevant literature, including the need for a game prototype to have been developed and for the game to specifically target children with cancer as a target audience. Data were extracted including age ranges, treatment and procedure plan, time context, users, purpose, and technology. The resulting serious games were grouped based on their purpose and were classified in three main categories; motivation, education, and distraction. This review demonstrates the positive use of serious games as an intervention for paediatric cancer patients that undergo treatment in hospital. The results suggest that the design of these serious games should consider the purpose of the game within the treatment plan of target audience; the accessibility and suitability of the technology used for the game; and social connection during play.},

  year={2022},

  abstract={This study examined arousal and engagement during video game play for interactive players and passive spectators who watched a recording of gameplay. We examined interactive (online) and noninteractive (offline) events in the game design. We collected psychophysiological data (eye movements, pupil dilation, heart rate) and self-reported measures (general anxiety, game experience, levels of fear). Overall, playing the game was associated with general increases in heart rate and a significant increase in the mean fixations distance. During offline events, players and spectators showed similar levels of arousal as indicated by pupil dilation. During online events, however, players showed increased pupil dilation—more so than someone who is watching the exact event without interactive control. These findings suggest that both players and spectators show increases in arousal and engagement, but there is a unique level of arousal and engagement for interactive play, as indicated by changes in heart rate and eye-tracking metrics. We discuss the application of the psychophysiological findings to recent trends in consumer media such as Twitch and YouTube, as well as the importance of game design, as it relates to human behavior.},

  abstract={Nowadays, gamification is used to improve the enterprises’ relationship with customers and employees. Employee engagement as one of the significant achievements of gamification is a major factor for increasing organizational productivity. In this paper we try to theorize the role of gamification in the enterprises from the employee perspective. The main objective of this research is to identify the major role of gamification as a new facilitating technology and organizational capability through examining the nomological network of influences. We highlight the strong interactions among three organizational capabilities in the form of mechanic options, dynamics, and positive emotions and their mediating role between gamification competence and enterprise’s performance. Using a mixed method through expert interviews and questionnaires, we determined the proposed model and localized it to a 1,000-member banking organization. The proposed conceptual model shows that from a gamification standpoint, what factors and how they can cause and increase the employee engagement and thereby improve the organizational performance and capabilities. Using a mixed method, we have shown that there is a statistically significant improvement with positive emotion and that a good feeling of employees toward the system will have a positive impact on their preference for their work. This paper forwards an important debate on the conceptualizing the role of gamification in contemporary enterprises performance by applying gamified approaches, which contributes to literature on internal and enterprise gamification.},

  abstract={Tangibles, in the form of physical artefacts that are electronically augmented and enhanced to trigger various digital events to happen, have the potential for providing innovative ways for children to play and learn, through novel forms of interacting and discovering. They offer, in addition, the scope for bringing playfulness back into learning. To this end, we designed an adventure game, where pairs of children have to discover as much as they can about a virtual imaginary creature called the Snark, through collaboratively interacting with a suite of tangibles. Underlying the design of the tangibles is a variety of transforms, which the children have to understand and reflect upon in order to make the Snark come alive and show itself in a variety of morphological and synaesthesic forms. The paper also reports on the findings of a study of the Snark game and discusses what it means to be engrossed in playful learning.},
