  abstract={An extension of the blind source separation technique based on the second-order blind identification (SOBI) approach is presented to separate mixtures of delayed sources. When the delay is small such that the first-order Taylor approximation holds, the delayed mixture is transformed as the mixture of the original sources and their derivatives. Two algorithms are proposed for the rotation step that recovers the extended source vector (original sources and the corresponding derivatives). The first approach is based on the odd symmetry of the derivative of the autocorrelation function; and the second method identifies the locations of single auto terms in the optimized time-scale plane. A simulation analysis was conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms. The results showed that the proposed methods substantially improved the performance of SOBI and its extension in the time-scale plane when the sources presented delays in the mixtures. In addition, the proposed algorithms were applied representatively to experimental multichannel surface electromyographic signals to identify motor unit action potential trains from the interference signal. The performance of the proposed methods was superior to previous methods also in this representative application. In conclusion, extensions of the SOBI approach of source separation have been proposed for the case of sources being delayed in the mixtures. These techniques were proven superior to previous approaches.},

  abstract={Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are obstructive respiratory diseases that affect negatively the quality of life for patients and their families worldwide. Despite the significance of these diseases, their management has been considered suboptimal around the world, whereas the improper inhaler use has been underlined as one of the main causes. Toward this direction, this paper presents an integrated mHealth system that provides real-time personalized feedback to patients for assessing the proper medication use and educating them and helping them avoid common mistakes. The identification of proper inhaler use is based on conventional and data-driven feature extraction and classification methods employed for the identification of four events (inhaler actuation, inhalation, exhalation, and background noise). The proposed scheme reaches 98% classification accuracy significantly outperforming recent and relevant state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, intuitive feedback interfaces were implemented in the form of a virtual guidance agent integrated with the mobile application, which can help patients follow their action plan and assess their inhaler technique in a more engaging manner. Extensive simulation studies, carried out using 12 subjects, demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed approaches in both indoor and outdoor environments.},

First, they investigated the scalability of Distributed Virtual Environments (DiVE), the networking framework they developed for multiuser 3D virtual world applications. The "area of interest" method that DiVE uses was tested in a laboratory setting and showed promising results on two important metrics: bandwidth and frames per second. Second, they ran a small marketing campaign to collect data from users interacting with the iPad version of iCO2 "in the wild." They then analyzed the users' acceleration behavior, an important aspect of eco-driving.},

  abstract={In the interrupting process of a three-phase vacuum interrupter, there exists a transverse magnetic field (TMF) in the interelectrode region, which is produced by adjacent phases. The deflection of the vacuum arc caused by TMF will affect the interrupting process of vacuum circuit breakers. In this paper, the vacuum arc characteristics considering the action of TMF produced by adjacent phases is simulated based on a steady 2-D asymmetrical magnetohydrodynamic model. The simulation results show that the vacuum arc will swing around and is especially obvious at the smaller current moments near current-zero during one ac half-cycle, because of the changed direction of TMF produced by adjacent phases. This kind of swing phenomena can also be observed in the electrode erosion of unsuccessful interruption. At the moments near current-zero, axial magnetic field is relatively weaker, while TMF generated by adjacent phases is relatively stronger, therefore, the offset phenomenon of plasma parameters is more significant. Compared with smaller diameter electrode arc, larger diameter electrode has larger arc deflection distance, while its value of plasma parameters is much smaller.},

  year={2017},

  pages={3286-3297},
  abstract={Road traffic simulation is a useful tool for studying road traffic and evaluating solutions to traffic problems. Large-scale agent-based road traffic simulation is computationally intensive, which triggers the need for conducting parallel simulation. This paper deals with the synchronization problem in parallel agent-based road traffic simulation to reduce the overall simulation execution time. We aim to reduce synchronization operations by introducing some redundant computation to the simulation. There is a trade-off between the benefit of reduced synchronization operations and the overhead of redundant computation. The challenge is to minimize the total overhead of redundant computation and synchronization. First, to determine the amount of redundant computation, we proposed a way to define extended layers of partitions in the road network. The sizes of extended layers are determined by the behavior of agents and the topology of road networks. Second, due to the dynamic nature of road traffic, a heuristic was proposed to adjust the amount of redundant computation according to traffic conditions during simulation run-time to minimize the overall simulation execution time. The efficiency of the proposed method was investigated in a parallel agent-based road traffic simulator using real-world network and trip data. Results have shown that the method can reduce synchronization overhead and improve the overall performance of the parallel simulation significantly.},

  abstract={Several studies have been conducted in the field of Technology Enhanced Learning(TEL) have shown that the adaptation to learner’s learning styles is a task that must be taken into account during the design phase of the educational sequences in order to increase the student’s motivation. Cognitive psychologists have proposed various models of style, which it’s often represented by using multiple dimensions statistically estimated, each model suggests an instrument for measuring an individual’s learning style. Most of them use questionnaires such as (Honey and Mumford (1992), Kolb (1984), Index of Learning Styles (ILS)). This paper shows the results of a study that was addressed to doctoral students. The sample of the population was made up of 300 persons. The purpose of this study is to illustrate the effectiveness of the French version of the Index Learning Styles (ILS) and uses factor analysis for investigation into various dimensions to help students decrease the time spent on this test. The main finding of this paper is: 1) the integration of the French version of the ILS into eAdventure and 2) the generation of an adaptable learning game (LG) and the developement of a new version of the eAdventure authoring tool based on Eadventure Index of Learning Style (E-ILS), capable of fixing learners’ preferences (desires, habits, etc.).},

  year={2017},
  volume={16},

  pages={16-22},
  abstract={On the basis of the quasi-three-dimensional scaling equation and minimum bottom-central potential, a new short-channel-effect-degraded subthreshold behavior model for double-Fin multichannel FET (DFMcFET) is presented. It is shown that the deep trench of the DFMcFET is superior to the shallow one in respect of suppressing short-channel effects (SCEs) and reducing the threshold voltage roll-off and subthreshold roll-up. Meanwhile, the wide trench and thin gate oxide are required to resist SCEs and reduce the subthreshold behavior degradation as the channel length is further decreased. In comparison to the counterpart of conventional FinFET, DFMcFET not only provides the more conducting channel, but also enhances the immunity to SCEs due to its shorter scaling length. Besides, both threshold voltage roll-off ΔVTH and subthreshold swing roll-up ΔSS can be well controlled by the scaling theory. The allowable minimum channel length can be uniquely determined according to the criterion of the scaling factor. With its computational efficiency and simple form, the model can be easily used for the circuit application of the DFMcFET.},

  abstract={Monte Carlo simulations of La0.67Ca0.33MnO3 thin films by using the Metropolis algorithm and a nearest neighbor classical Heisenberg model were carried out. Films were simulated by considering system sizes of L × L × d magnetic ions, being d the film thickness, which was varied, and L the linear dimension of the basal plane, which was kept fixed at a high enough value. In the simulation we have differentiated three types of ions, namely Mn4+d3, Mn3+eg, and Mn3+eg' with their corresponding coupling constants. Hence, the effect of substituting Mn ions by vacancies upon the magnetic properties of the films was addressed. Magnetization, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat curves as a function of temperature were obtained. Results indicate that the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition temperature Tc increases until reaching the value reported for the bulk material (~260 K) as the film thickness increases above 9 magnetic unit cells. Moreover, as the vacancies percentage increases, Tc exhibits a linear decrease without depending of the sample thickness; this is caused by the decrease in the magnetic bonds density.},

  year={2023},

  number={},
  pages={16723-16734},
  abstract={Recently, various visual information presentation systems known as human–machine interfaces (HMIs), such as road projection lamp systems, have been developed for safe driving. However, it is unclear how these HMIs change the drivers’ gaze behavior and improve their cognitive awareness of the environment. Therefore, in this study, we introduce the concept of potential attention to propose a probabilistic method to estimate drivers’ gaze behavior when using HMIs. The potential attention hypothesis can propose an explanation to understand gaze behavior. This method assigns potential attention to objects the driver is likely to gaze, such as vehicles and pedestrians, thereby estimating the driver’s potential gaze point from potential attentions. The study is divided into two steps. The first step analyzes the drivers’ gaze behavior in the simulator experiment when a road projection lamp is displayed to alert pedestrians. In the second step, we propose a method for estimating the driver’s gaze through the potential attention method based on the results of the simulator experiment. The modeling results for gaze behavior measured in the simulator experiment as the first step show that gaze behavior can be estimated with high accuracy. This proposed method is expected to apply to a method to determine where the HMI display should be placed.},

  abstract={While the emergence of the Industry 4.0 (I4.0) concept has heightened concerns about how digital transformation will affect employees, engineers who create, develop, and spread the I4.0 tools and technologies are ignored. Also, the industries with the highest digital maturity should be prioritized since they are the readiest ones for the I4.0 transformation. In this context, our focus is the engineers in the Turkish white goods industry, one of the three industries with the highest level of digital maturity in Turkey. We aim to determine the new skills expected from engineers and to uncover the impact of the perceived usage level of I4.0 technologies by engineers on the dimensions of engineering work. In this article, we conducted two separate surveys for engineers and managers and sought answers to four research questions using factor analysis and regression analysis. The results show that the new skills are divided into intrinsic motivation, technology, and data and information skills. At the same time, the perceived usage level of I4.0 technologies influences the social characteristics dimension of engineering work. We revealed that the sociability level of the engineers who use data analytics, artificial intelligence, simulation, and RFID/RTLS technologies while performing their jobs tends to decrease, while the sociability level of the engineers who use adaptive robots and additive manufacturing technologies gets higher.},

  year={2024},

  pages={5750-5764},
  abstract={Traffic intersections are important scenes that can be seen almost everywhere in the traffic system. Currently, most simulation methods perform well at highways and urban traffic networks. In intersection scenarios, the challenge lies in the lack of clearly defined lanes, where agents with various motion plannings converge in the central area from different directions. Traditional model-based methods are difficult to drive agents to move realistically at intersections without enough predefined lanes, while data-driven methods often require a large amount of high-quality input data. Simultaneously, tedious parameter tuning is inevitable involved to obtain the desired simulation results. In this paper, we present a novel adaptive and planning-aware hybrid-driven method (TraInterSim) to simulate traffic intersection scenarios. Our hybrid-driven method combines an optimization-based data-driven scheme with a velocity continuity model. It guides the agent's movements using real-world data and can generate those behaviors not present in the input data. Our optimization method fully considers velocity continuity, desired speed, direction guidance, and planning-aware collision avoidance. Agents can perceive others’ motion plannings and relative distances to avoid possible collisions. To preserve the individual flexibility of different agents, the parameters in our method are automatically adjusted during the simulation. TraInterSim can generate realistic behaviors of heterogeneous agents in different traffic intersection scenarios in interactive rates. Through extensive experiments as well as user studies, we validate the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed simulation method.},

Theoretical models are proposed which compose formalized descriptions from both top-down and bottom-up perspectives. Based on the description, the UAF profile is proposed to represent the SoS mission and constituent systems (CS) goal. Moreover, the agent-based simulation information is also described based on the overview, design concepts, and details (ODD) protocol as the complement part of the SoS profile, which can be transformed into different simulation platforms based on the eXtensible markup language (XML) technology and model-to-text method. In this way, the design of the SoS is simulated automatically in the early design stage. Finally, the method is implemented and an example is given to illustrate the whole process.},

  abstract={Analysis of motion patterns is an effective approach for anomaly detection and behavior prediction. Current approaches for the analysis of motion patterns depend on known scenes, where objects move in predefined ways. It is highly desirable to automatically construct object motion patterns which reflect the knowledge of the scene. In this paper, we present a system for automatically learning motion patterns for anomaly detection and behavior prediction based on a proposed algorithm for robustly tracking multiple objects. In the tracking algorithm, foreground pixels are clustered using a fast accurate fuzzy k-means algorithm. Growing and prediction of the cluster centroids of foreground pixels ensure that each cluster centroid is associated with a moving object in the scene. In the algorithm for learning motion patterns, trajectories are clustered hierarchically using spatial and temporal information and then each motion pattern is represented with a chain of Gaussian distributions. Based on the learned statistical motion patterns, statistical methods are used to detect anomalies and predict behaviors. Our system is tested using image sequences acquired, respectively, from a crowded real traffic scene and a model traffic scene. Experimental results show the robustness of the tracking algorithm, the efficiency of the algorithm for learning motion patterns, and the encouraging performance of algorithms for anomaly detection and behavior prediction.},

  abstract={As a good example of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS), Advisory Speed Assistance (ASA) helps improve driving safety and possibly energy efficiency by showing advisory speed to the driver of an intelligent vehicle. However, driver-based speed tracking errors often emerge, due to the perception and reaction delay, as well as imperfect vehicle control, degrading the effectiveness of ASA system. In this study, we propose a learning-based approach to modeling driver behavior, aiming to predict and compensate for the speed tracking errors in real time. Subject drivers are first classified into different types according to their driving behaviors using the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. A nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) neural network is then adopted to predict the speed tracking errors generated by each driver. A specific traffic scenario has been created in a Unity game engine-based driving simulator platform, where ASA system provides advisory driving speed to the driver via a head-up display (HUD). A human-in-the-loop simulation study is conducted by 17 volunteer drivers, revealing a 53% reduction in the speed error variance and a 3% reduction in the energy consumption with the compensation of the speed tracking errors. The results are further validated by a field implementation with a real passenger vehicle.},

  abstract={Collaborative healthcare environments offer potential benefits, including enhancing the healthcare quality delivered to patients and reducing costs. As a direct consequence, sharing of electronic health records (EHRs) among healthcare providers has experienced a noteworthy growth in the last years, since it enables physicians to remotely monitor patients' health and enables individuals to manage their own health data more easily. However, these scenarios face significant challenges regarding security and privacy of the extremely sensitive information contained in EHRs. Thus, a flexible, efficient, and standards-based solution is indispensable to guarantee selective identity information disclosure and preserve patient's privacy. We propose a privacy-aware profile management approach that empowers the patient role, enabling him to bring together various healthcare providers as well as user-generated claims into an unique credential. User profiles are represented through an adaptive Merkle Tree, for which we formalize the underlying mathematical model. Furthermore, performance of the proposed solution is empirically validated through simulation experiments.},

  abstract={To understand commonsense reasoning, it is necessary to discover what kinds of problems a commonsense reasoner should be able to solve, what the reasoner needs to have in order to solve those problems, and the relationships among the various kinds of problem-solving abilities. Four methods for performing qualitative reasoning about the behaviour of physical situations are examined. Three of the methods perform qualitative simulation, which determines the behavior of a situation by a qualitative version of simulation methods. The other method is called consolidation, which derives the behavior of a situation by composing the behavior of the situation's components. The work shows that qualitative simulation and consolidation work on different problems of qualitative reasoning, and that their differences and similarities lead to several implications about their role in qualitative reasoning.<>},

  abstract={With the development of autonomous vehicles, advanced driver-assistance systems, and vehicular social networks, the requirement for vehicle trajectory prediction in lane changing is higher. Here, we propose a neural-network-based operational level lane-changing model using data-driven methods. First, we determine the inputs of the lane-changing model by analyzing the influence factors of the lanechanging behavioral model under the framework of the social force theory. The main influencing factors include the temporal destination, the historical trajectories of the lane-changing vehicle, and the relative distance between the surrounding vehicles in our lane-changing model. Our lane-changing model is built by deep neural networks (DNNs). Then, we determine the suitable network structure and other parameters by empirical data for the DNN. Finally, tests on empirical lane-changing trajectory data sets show that the operational level lane-changing model built by DNN is promising.},

  abstract={Evaluation of cooperative automated driving applications requires the capability of simulating the vehicle and traffic dynamics as well as the communications with a level of accuracy that most of the current tools still lack. In this paper, we explore the use of game engines in hybrid traffic-network simulators. We describe and validate a novel framework based on this approach: Veneris. Our framework is made of a traffic simulator, implemented on the top of the Unity game engine, which includes a realistic vehicle model and a set of driving and lane change behaviors adapted to a 3D environment that reproduces real-world traffic dynamics; a ray-launching propagation simulator on graphics-processing-unit (GPU), called Opal, and a set of modules, which enable bidirectional coupling with the OMNET++ network simulator. The more relevant and novel mechanisms of Veneris are introduced, but further implementation details can be checked on the source code provided in our repository. We discuss the validation tests we have performed and show how it provides accurate results in three key areas: 1) the fidelity of the vehicle dynamics; 2) the recreation of realistic traffic flows, and; 3) the accuracy of the propagation simulation. In addition, the general results of the expected performance are provided.},

  pages={68878-68891},
  abstract={While action video games have been shown effective for training attention, little research has explored how to effectively utilize haptic interaction in these games for attention modulation and training. In this paper, we introduce a visuo-haptic game combining fingertip force control with an immersive visual display. In the proposed stimulus-reaction game, users are required to press a force sensor using either the index or middle finger from both hands. In order to be successful in a trial, users must respond swiftly to the visual cues by producing an accurate fingertip force within an allowable duration of time. The difficulty levels of the task are adjusted dynamically by an adaptive model to achieve a constant success rate. Validation tests on 12 participants confirmed that the proposed model is actually able to maintain an expected success rate of 75% within ±5% fluctuation. With the proposed game, 12 trainees were subsequently administered pre- and post-tests in the first and last day of a longitudinal experiment to examine efficacy of training on the sustained-attention-to-response task (SART) and the Stroop task. The results from these two typical batteries of attention test show that significant improvements were found after five days of attention training. Overall, these data illustrate the potential of the proposed visuo-haptic game for attention training.},

  abstract={Aside from hand-coded bots, most of the videogame agents rely on experience in one way or another. Some agents improve over time by adjusting to real experience, while others make projections by leveraging simulated experience. In one sense, human play seems to resemble simulation, in that human players often try to visualize possible trajectories before deciding on a real course of action. However, most of the existing simulation-based agents require precise knowledge of the game's code, and their search depth is limited by the granular time scales encountered in videogames. Human players, on the other hand, appear to visualize plans in terms of abstract “skills,” such as running and jumping. These skills are learned from real experience, so,in this sense, human play resembles learning-based approaches. Motivated by these observations, we propose an approach that bridges the gap between skills, which are uncertain in outcome and duration, and traditional simulation-based planning, which is discrete. We apply this approach to maze-like navigation problems in Infinite Mario. After an initial skill acquisition phase, our agent is capable of navigating new levels without further training and also scales better with goal distance than a granular simulation method that exploits exact knowledge of the game's physics.},

  abstract={Recent years have witnessed a steady growth in the achievable quantum systems due to advancements in qubit technology across several hardware platforms. Currently entering an era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) systems brings additional design challenges. In these systems, each individual qubit is accompanied by a substantial amount of classical CMOS circuitry for qubit instantiation, control and readout, which is to be integrated at the cryo temperature. This work presents a methodology for the co-design and co-simulation of silicon spin qubits in quantum dots, together with their associated cryo-CMOS circuitry, relying on an established spin qubit compact model. In addition, a detailed procedure is proposed for the integration of the model into a classical design flow, which is crucial for the usability of the model in practice. This is illustrated by simulating the readout of a qubit using a complete CMOS readout chip that behaves in a realistic, nonideal way. Bringing the design to a single simulation environment allows for the capture and analysis of effects that otherwise are not possible to simulate when considering the qubits and the cryo-CMOS circuitry separately. This opens up opportunities for more robust design in the future.},

  abstract={Automated and connected vehicles are emerging in the market. Currently, solutions are being proposed to use these technologies for cooperative driving, which can significantly improve road safety. Vehicular safety applications must be tested before deployment. It is challenging to verify and validate them in the real world. Therefore, simulation is used for this purpose. Modeling these technologies necessitates coupled the use of traffic flow, vehicle dynamics, communication network, perception and signal propagation models. State-of-the-art tools exist in these domains; however, they lack full domain coverage, and the low-level processes that affect each vehicle’s behavior are often left unaccounted for, which (according to complex system theory) can lead to erroneous assumptions about system-level outcomes. This paper analyzes the requirements for an integrated connected and automated vehicle simulation environment for simulating vehicle behavior with consideration of surrounding objects’ influence on machine perception and signal propagation. We discuss the shortcomings of existing methods, propose an architecture for a simulation environment with full domain coverage, and develop a preliminary version of the CAVISE integrated simulation environment for connected and automated vehicles using open-source tools. Scenarios of object detection and signal exchange were simulated, and data on the influence of surrounding objects on quantitative and qualitative changes in scenario simulation results was obtained. It was found that a more accurate description of surrounding objects and their influence on machine perception and signal transmission does lead to quantitative and qualitative changes in the measured parameters. This conclusion should be further used in simulation environment development for connected and automated vehicle technology verification and validation.},

  abstract={The challenging issue of driver-automation copilot opens up a new frontier to enhancing driving safety and comfort. Due to the complex and changeable external environment and driver-automation interaction, shared control which can adaptively coordinate the control authority between human driver and intelligent automation according to different driving conditions still remains open and challenging. The novelty of this article is to introduce the concept of “desired lateral driving zone,” “act-and-wait” intermittent characteristics and several statistical quantitative indexes for driving ability, aiming to better describe lane-keeping behaviors of different driver groups, especially for the steering maneuver scenarios. In order to enhance safety and reduce conflict issues, this research goes one step further in investigating the active coordination of control authority, and an adaptive driver-automation control authority model is designed, effectively providing smooth transition of control authority as the game evolves. Then a noncooperative-game-based model predictive control algorithm taking into consideration driver steering behavior characteristics is proposed to improve friendliness and reliability of driver-automation interaction. Finally, the comparative experimental results demonstrate that the proposed shared control algorithm can achieve a favorable improvement in driver’s acceptance, riding comfort and safety.},

  abstract={The DC-coupled resistive silicon detectors (DC-RSD) are the evolution of the AC-coupled RSD (RSD) design, both based on the low-gain avalanche diode (LGAD) technology. The DC-RSD design concept intends to address a few known issues present in RSDs (e.g., baseline fluctuation and long tail-bipolar signals) while maintaining their advantages (e.g., signal spreading and 100% fill factor). The simulation of DC-RSD presents several unique challenges linked to the complex nature of its design and the large pixel size. The defining feature of DC-RSD, charge sharing over distances that can be as large as a millimeter, represents a formidable challenge for technology CAD (TCAD), the standard simulation tool. To circumvent this problem, we have developed a mixed-mode approach to the DC-RSD simulation, which exploits a combination of two simulation tools: TCAD and SPICE. Thanks to this hybrid approach, it has been possible to demonstrate that, according to the simulation, the key features of the RSD—excellent timing and spatial resolutions (few tens of picoseconds and few microns)—are maintained in the DC-RSD design. In this work, we present the developed models and methodology, mainly showing the results of device-level numerical simulation, which have been obtained with the state-of-the-art Synopsys Sentaurus TCAD suite of tools. Such results will provide all the necessary information for the first batch of DC-RSD produced by the Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) foundry in Trento, Italy.},

  pages={228-242},
  abstract={Readers construct at least two interrelated representations when they comprehend a text: (a) a propositional representation containing the individual ideas that are derived from each sentence and the relations among them and (b) a discourse model, a representation of the context or situation to which the text refers. We used a paradigm called “item priming in recognition” to examine how these representations are stored in the cerebral hemispheres. In Experiment 1, the priming paradigm was used in combination with a lateralized visual field (VF) procedure. We found evidence that readers' representations were structured according to propositional relations, but only in the left hemisphere. Item recognition was facilitated when a concept was preceded by another concept from the same proposition when targets were presented to the left, but not to the right, hemisphere. We found priming in both hemispheres, however, when targets were context-appropriate senses of ambiguous words or topics of passages. In Experiment 2, we replicated the priming effects in three callosotomy patients. We argue that the distinction between a propositional representation and a discourse model is important with respect to how discourse is represented in the brain. The propositional representation appears to reside in the left hemisphere, whereas aspects of the discourse model appear to be represented in both hemispheres.},

In the Monte Carlo simulation, it is important to define the proper order parameters to describe the spin model, where the magnetization is used as an order parameter for ferromagnetic spin model and the staggered magnetization is used as an order parameter for the antiferromagnetic spin model without geometrical frustration. However, it is difficult to define an order parameter for frustrated spin models. We perform the Monte Carlo simulation for the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin model using the damage spreading as an order parameter, and also perform simulation using both the magnetization and the staggered magnetization as order parameters. Then, we measure the critical temperatures and the critical exponents on three-dimensional regular lattice estimated by different order parameters, and then study the dependency of critical behaviors on different order parameters for the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin models.},

  abstract={A general numerical approach was developed to simulate the mechanical properties and the failure of heterogeneous elasto-plastic materials using statistical distributions of the material properties. An appropriate elastic-plastic constitutive relation is used to describe the material behavior and failure in each element, with a two-parameter Weibull distribution used to produce the initial heterogeneous material property variations. An adaptive incremental load-step is applied so that only one or a few elements (or integration points) change their status (i.e., from elastic to plastic, or from plastic to strain failure) within one load step. A failed element is then assigned a very small modulus to simulate the failure rather than removing it from the model, which keeps the continuity of the geometric mesh. The numerical results show that the model is suitable for simulating the effective mechanical properties and failure of heterogeneous materials with local elasto-plastic constitutive relations.},

  abstract={Lane change maneuver is a complicated maneuver, and incorrect maneuvering is an important reason for expressway accidents and fatalities. In this scenario, automated lane change has great potential to reduce the number of accidents. Previous research in this area, typically, focuses on the generation of an optimal lane change trajectory, while ignoring the human behavior model. To understand the human lane change behavior model, we carried out experiments on Japanese expressways. By analyzing the human-driver lane change data, we propose a two-segment lane change model that mimics the human-driver. We categorize the driving environment based on the observation grid and propose different lane change behaviors to handle the different scenarios. We develop an intuitive method to select the suitable lane change behavior, for a given scenario, using active (accelerate/decelerate) and passive (wait) information derived from the distance and related velocity (dx/dv) graph. Additionally, we also identify the most desirable and safe conditions for doing lane change based on the human driver preference data. We evaluated the proposed model by performing lane change simulations in the PreScan environment, while considering the vehicle motion/control model. The simulation results show the proposed model is able to handle complicated lane change scenarios with human driver-like performance.},

  abstract={Power hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL) simulations need to be accurate to truly reflect the behavior of the systems under test. However, a PHIL simulation may result in errors or even instability due to imperfections (e.g., time delay, noise injection, phase lag, and limited bandwidth) in the power interface, particularly in high-power applications. Additionally, it is usually difficult to determine the accuracy of a simulation because there is no reference available for people to know the ldquoshould-berdquo system responses in advance. Therefore, a method is demanded to predict the accuracy of PHIL simulations. In this paper, an effective method for evaluating the PHIL accuracy is proposed. This method provides a means to justify the result of a PHIL simulation analytically and quantitatively instead of empirically. While the method is based on linear system analysis, it is shown to be also applicable for nonlinear PHIL systems.},

This paper analyzes how the application of gamification strategies in MOOCs on energy sustainability affects participants' engagement and seeks to identify what types of interactive gamification media are more useful in generating interest and motivation in students. In order to do so, a mixed quasi-experimental method is used. A gamification board with challenges, badges, and leaderboards to a sample is used, and at the same time, this platform is analyzed using the integrated theoretical gamification model in e-learning environments. In the MOOCs where gamification strategies were applied, a global completion rate of 14.43% was obtained, while in those without gamification, 6.162% was obtained. Likewise, the degree of student engagement with respect to the completion rate of activities was much higher in the gamified platform (28.032%) than in the traditional design (13.252%). The results show that applying gamification strategies in MOOCs achieves a higher level of engagement and student motivation.},

  abstract={Power system simulation is an important means to study the dynamic behavior, to ensure the safety and stability, and to optimize the operation of a power grid. Pure physical simulation and digital simulation have their own advantages and disadvantages. A three-phase four-wire hybrid simulation platform integrating the advantages of both the digital simulation and physical simulation is developed by combining the physical simulation system and real-time digital simulator. The platform is rated at 400 V and 50 kVA with the short-circuit capacity of 500 kVA and can supply ten times the rated current to support the simulation of various short-circuit faults. An improved interface algorithm based on an ideal transformer model is proposed to extend the stability region of a hybrid simulation. Hybrid simulation experiments are conducted under two cases, and the comparison with the digital simulation demonstrates the performance of this platform and the potential applied to a modern power system. This platform has been equipped in a key laboratory of smart power grid technology.},

  abstract={A finite-element (FE) model of human skin is proposed for future use in an interactive real-time surgical simulation to teach surgeons procedures, such as facial reconstruction using skin-flap repair. For this procedure, skin is cut into flaps that are stretched to cover openings in the face. Thus, the model must recreate the visual, haptic, and force feedback expected by the surgeon. To develop the FE model, a series of in vitro experiments were conducted on samples of human skin, subjected to uniaxial and planar tensile straining. Reduced polynomial hyperelastic (HE) materials were found to fit many of the samples’ stress–strain data well. Finally, an explicit dynamic FE mesh was developed based on the fitted HE material models. A total Lagrangian formulation with the half-step central difference method was employed to integrate the dynamic equation of motion of the mesh. The mesh was integrated into two versions of a real-time skin simulator: a single-threaded version running on a computer’s main central processing unit and a multithreaded version running on the computer’s graphics card. The latter was achieved by exploiting recent advances in programmable graphics technology.},

Formal definitions of Nash, general metarational, symmetric metarational, and sequential stability decision rules reflecting human behavior under conflict are presented in this paper. The definitions are inspired by the solution concepts of the graph model for conflict resolution and are conceived for implantation in the proposed agent-based modeling and simulation framework. With these decision rules, competitive and cooperative conflict dynamics are simulated for a theoretical common-pool resources dilemma. Moreover, policies can be tested for their effectiveness in avoiding or recouping from a tragedy of the commons.},

Through this work, we can also theoretically analyze the behavior of the periodic APA, which updates its weights periodically. Simulation results show that our theoretical results coincide closely with simulations.},

We introduce and derive an accurate approximation of a frequency domain measure—the power transfer function—and show how it can be used to predict the convergence rate, system stability bound and the steady-state behavior of the entire cancellation system across frequency and time. We consider three example adaptive algorithms in the cancellation system: the least mean square, normalized least mean square, and the recursive least squares algorithms. Furthermore, we derive expressions to determine the step size parameter in the adaptive algorithms to achieve a desired system behavior, e.g., convergence rate at a specific frequency. Finally, we compare and discuss the performance of all three adaptive algorithms, and we verify the derived expressions through simulation experiments.},

  abstract={Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks have emerged as one of the most promising approaches to improve the scalability of Video-on-Demand (VoD) service over Internet. However, despite a number of architectures and streaming protocols have been proposed in past years, there is few work to study the practical performance of P2P-based VoD service especially in consideration of real user behavior which actually has significant impact on system scalability. Therefore, in this paper, we first characterize the user behavior by analyzing a large amount of real traces from a popular VoD system supported by the biggest television station in China, cctv.com. Then we ex-amine the practical scalability of P2P-based VoD service through extensive trace-driven simula-tion under a general system framework. The results show that P2P networks scale well in provid-ing VoD service under real user behavior by obtaining a considerable good cache hit ratio. Moreover, it is observed that adopting hard cache at client side help achieves better system scal-ability than that with soft cache. We also identify the impact of various aspects of user behavior upon system scalability through detailed simulation. We believe that our study will shine insight-ful light on the understanding of practical scalability of P2P-based VoD service and be helpful to future system design and optimization.},

  abstract={It is important to investigate the stability and behavior of an epoxy-resin-impregnated no-insulation (NI) REBCO pancake coil to implement high-field applications, such as ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging. We have performed sudden discharging and overcurrent tests for the impregnated NI REBCO pancake coil. From the discharging test, the contact resistivity is estimated, and it changes depending on the initial current. From the overcurrent test, the high thermal stability of the impregnated NI REBCO pancake coil is confirmed. The REBCO pancake coil is charged up to 67 A though the critical current is only 46 A, and no degradation has been found. To investigate in detail the electromagnetic behavior of an impregnated NI REBCO pancake coil, the simulation is performed by means of the partial element equivalent circuit (PEEC) model. In the sudden discharging test, the simulation results for the case of lower initial current are in good agreement with the experimental data. As can be inferred from the simulation results, the current drastically decreases from the inside of the impregnated NI REBCO pancake coil. The result of the overcurrent simulation is almost identical to the experimental one. However, since the contact resistivity is presumed to be constant in the simulation, the difference is observed in the high current region.},

  abstract={The deployment of new sensors and devices on electric distribution systems is increasing the awareness of phenomena characterized by intermittent periods of highly dynamic activity that occur within extended periods of relatively static behavior. The deployment of new devices has enabled the observation of these phenomena; however, the currently available simulation methods cannot accurately reproduce the entire system behavior. Existing simulation methods, and their associated models, are able to capture portions of these phenomena, but there is not a method for efficiently modeling the entire event in a single simulation. This paper presents a novel method of adaptive simulation that enables automated transitions between quasi-static time-series and electromechancial simulation modes, as necessary to capture relevant system dynamics. The transitions between the simulation modes are triggered automatically during the running simulation based on the evolution of the system variables, utilizing multistate modes for generators and motors. This method allows for a single simulation that spans the entire time-frame, has the ability to capture dynamic events, and includes all relevant power system controls. The method of adaptive simulation can support the direct analysis of dynamic power system events, co-simulation of transmission and distribution systems, the development of control systems, and the development of reduced-order models.},

  abstract={Serious games (SGs) have emerged in recent years as a key method to augment education and training. SGs allow players to experience new concepts while exploring engaging virtual environments. To further extend the educational merit of SGs, adaptive SGs integrate games with adaptive systems to provide a more supportive education. Typically, these adaptive systems either focus on assisting or engaging the player, or on providing a more human-like tutoring experience. For appropriate adaptation, these games make use of player analytics and player modeling to determine what help to provide, predict future player actions, or otherwise model a player’s mental or physical state. To assist researchers in the development of future adaptive SGs, this article reviews and categorizes both player modeling and game adaptation methods from publications over the past ten years. We offer comparisons of various methods to achieve both modeling and adaptation, as well as comprehensive categories for both aspects. Furthermore, we also offer insights for future areas of study in adaptive SGs, as well as possible directions for SG developers.},

  abstract={We propose a fault simulation technique for multiple faults based on a deductive fault simulation method. The main difficulty in the development of a technique for multiple fault simulation is handling a very large number of multiple faults. Conventional deductive simulation using Linear lists to store fault sets is not appropriate for such large sets of multiple faults. Our approach to this problem is to represent sets of multiple faults by Boolean functions. We assign a distinct code word to each multiple fault and represent the fault by a minterm corresponding to its code word. Then, set operations in deductive simulation are replaced by logic operations. As an internal representation of fault sets, we use shared binary decision diagrams. The method of coding multiple faults is a key to efficient simulation. We propose a coding method called FNT coding. We also propose a fault dropping method, called prime fault dropping, which is used efficiently with our multiple fault simulation technique. Experimental results show that our technique effectively handles multiple faults at significantly lower computation cost.<>},

  abstract={The salience of a narrative event is defined as the ease with which an audience member can recall that past event. This paper describes a series of experiments investigating the use of salience as a predictor of player behavior in interactive narrative scenarios. We utilize Indexter, a plan-based model of narrative for reasoning about salience. Indexter defines a mapping of five event indices identified by cognitive science research onto narrative planning event structures. The indices-protagonist, time, space, causality, and intentionality-correspond to the “who, when, where, how, and why” of a narrative event, and represent dimensions by which events can be linked in short-term memory. We first evaluate Indexter's claim that it can effectively model the salience of past events in a player's mind. Next, we demonstrate that salience can be used to predict players' choices for endings in an interactive story, and finally, we demonstrate that the same technique can be applied to influence players to choose certain endings.},

  abstract={Directly using brain signals to drive vehicles is called brain-control driving, which has the potential to help people with disabilities to acquire driving ability. Developing driver models of the brain-control driving can help understand and simulate the driver behaviors, which contributes to the development of the brain-control driving. In this paper, to simulate the car-following behavior of the brain-control driving, we propose two brain-control car-following models, i.e., CF-BCB and CF-BCI models. The two models are built by integrating a car-following decision model with a brain-control behavior model and a brain-computer interface (BCI) performance model in the queuing network (QN) cognitive architecture, respectively. The manual- and brain-control experiments are conducted to collect the car-following data of the ideal and real brain-control driving, respectively. Simulations with the proposed models are performed to mimic the ideal and real brain-control driving of different subjects. We compare the performance of the car-following decision model and two decision models extended from the intelligent driver model (IDM) and the full velocity difference model (FVDM), respectively. The comparison results show that the car-following decision model performs better than the two decision models in simulating the ideal brain-control driving. Besides, we prove the effectiveness of the proposed models in simulating the car-following behaviors of the brain-control drivers by comparing the simulation and experimental results.},

  abstract={The rescue behavior and information dissemination behavior of entrepreneurs affect the number of infected enterprises and thus the credit risk contagion. We construct an epidemic model considering entrepreneurial behavior. A double -layer network consisting of entrepreneur social network and enterprise network is built based on the small world network. Through theoretical analysis of the threshold and simulation of the model, the impact of entrepreneurs’ rescue behavior and information dissemination behavior on credit risk contagion is studied. The results are as follows. Both the rescue and the information dissemination behavior of entrepreneurs are conducive to restraining the contagion of credit risk, while the rescue behavior has a better influence on controlling the contagion. In addition, the tendency of rescue objectives will affect the credit risk contagion. Moreover, improving the social rate among entrepreneurs is conducive to curbing the credit risk contagion.

  abstract={Modern Computer Game AL still relies on rulebased approaches, so far failing to develop a convincing, human-like opponent. Towards the development of more human-like computer game agents, we propose an approach for learning strategies by observation of human players, principally viewing the design of a computer game agent as a problem of pattern recognition. First we introduce a Neural Gas based grid learning of an internal representation of the 3D game-world. Then we discuss the use of a learning potential fields approach, establishing a mapping from world state vectors to corresponding potential field forces for agent guidance. The training data being used is acquired by observation of human players acting in the 3D game environment of a commercial computer game. Finally, some experiments are presented.},

  abstract={Contribution: This article presents a Mars Exploration Control Virtual Simulation Experiment Platform (MEC-vslab), which aims to address the current challenge of limited integration between control engineering education and engineering practice. MEC-vslab is oriented toward the practical needs of Mars exploration engineering. It offers unparalleled advantages by transcending temporal and spatial restrictions and has been applied to several basic control engineering curriculums.Background: Owing to the limited applicability of conventional control engineering education in practical engineering, students encounter difficulties in connecting theoretical knowledge with real-world application scenarios. Due to the impact of environmental complexity and conditional limitations, teaching laboratories cannot realistically reproduce aerospace engineering application environments and problems, making it difficult to develop students’ ability to solve unknown engineering problems.Intended Outcomes: MEC-vslab facilitates students in acquiring comprehensive control knowledge, encompassing Mars rovers and drones’ dynamics modeling, controller design, and parameter configuration for strongly coupled systems. By engaging with this virtual simulation platform, students develop a profound understanding of cutting-edge control engineering principles, augmenting their proficiency in employing control theory to address practical engineering challenges.Application Design: MEC-vslab as a part of the control-related theoretical curriculum, it encompasses three stages. By completing these stages in succession, students are able to apply their theoretical knowledge toward solving practical engineering problems in a virtual setting.Findings: The analysis based on positive student feedback as well as their learning behavior and questionnaire research that the MEC-vslab is an effective learning tool to integrate control engineering education with high-precision engineering practice needs.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the evolutionary development of (problem solving) behavior. Through evolution, artificial animals learn to survive in a given world. We use layered neural networks (NNs) as the substrate on which evolutionary learning operates. The fault tolerance of neural networks allows for a genotype I phenotype distinction which maintains the variation in the genetic pool. Furthermore, we define building blocks which take into account the functionality of the NNs. The result of the algorithm can be inspected at two levels. First, there is the behavior of the individual animals. A description of their behavior is obtained through the induction of decision trees which describe the functionality of the NN. Second, the behavior of the population as a whole can be described. The distribution of the animals over the world often provides an analogical representation of a problem solution.},

  abstract={When presented with a water or an air gap barrier, animals often engage in peering, or side-to-sided head movements, before leaping across the barrier. This strategy is used instead of depth recovery using stereopsis, and likely gives a much better estimate of distance. In this article we present a neurocomputational model of peering, hosted on a small robot, that explains the essential characteristics of peering reported in the literature. The model builds on recent evidence for non-direction selective movement detectors in insects. Through non-linear transformation of the retinal image, the model produces a ‘leap’ command without intermediate reconstruction of the external space of the animal.},

  abstract={Digital twins represent real objects or subjects with their data, functions, and communication capabilities in the digital world. As nodes within the internet of things, they enable networking and thus the automation of complex value-added chains. The application of simulation techniques brings digital twins to life and makes them experimentable; digital twins become experimentable digital twins (EDTs). Initially, these EDTs communicate with each other purely in the virtual world. The resulting networks of interacting EDTs model different application scenarios and are simulated in virtual testbeds, providing new foundations for comprehensive simulation-based systems engineering. Its focus is on EDTs, which become more detailed with every single application. Thus, complete digital representations of the respective real assets and their behaviors are created successively. The networking of EDTs with real assets leads to hybrid application scenarios in which EDTs are used in combination with real hardware, thus realizing complex control algorithms, innovative user interfaces, or mental models for intelligent systems.},

  year={2015},
  volume={21},
  number={4},
  pages={520-528},
  abstract={When avoiding a group, a walker has two possibilities: either he goes through it or around it. Going through very dense groups or around huge ones would not seem natural and could break any sense of presence in a virtual environment. This paper aims to enable crowd simulators to handle such situations correctly. To this end, we need to understand how real humans decide to go through or around groups. As a first hypothesis, we apply the Principle of Minimum Energy (PME) on different group sizes and density. According to this principle, a walker should go around small and dense groups whereas he should go through large and sparse groups. Such principle has already been used for crowd simulation; the novelty here is to apply it to decide on a global avoidance strategy instead of local adaptations only. Our study quantifies decision thresholds. However, PME leaves some inconclusive situations for which the two solutions paths have similar energetic costs. In a second part, we propose an experiment to corroborate PME decisions thresholds with real observations. As controlling the factors of an experiment with many people is extremely hard, we propose to use Virtual Reality as a new method to observe human behavior. This work represents the first crowd simulation algorithm component directly designed from a VR-based study. We also consider the role of secondary factors in inconclusive situations. We show the influence of the group appearance and direction of relative motion in the decision process. Finally, we draw some guidelines to integrate our conclusions to existing crowd simulators and show an example of such integration. We evaluate the achieved improvements.},

  abstract={Network architectures for collaborative virtual reality have traditionally been dominated by client-server and peer-to-peer approaches, with peer-to-peer strategies typically being favored where minimizing latency is a priority and client-server where consistency is key. With increasingly sophisticated behavior models and the demand for better support for haptics, we argue that neither approach provides sufficient support for these scenarios nor, thus, a hybrid architecture is required. We discuss the relative performance of different distribution strategies in the face of real network conditions and illustrate the problems they face. Finally, we present an architecture that successfully meets many of these challenges and demonstrate its use in a distributed virtual prototyping application which supports simultaneous collaboration for assembly, maintenance, and training applications utilizing haptics},

The transistors' intrinsic performance and subthreshold characteristics are investigated for various channel lengths and Ge layer thicknesses. Our results indicate that both n- and p-channel GOI MOSFETs can be scaled down to the nanoregion, due to the nonstationary transport, especially for the p-channel device. More than 10% performance improvement for nMOS and about 20% for pMOS can be achieved in GOI even when channel length is scaled down to 20 nm, as compared to SOI devices. However, the GOI devices suffer from more severe short channel effect and have larger p-n junction leakage current as compared to SOI counterpart. For high-performance CMOS applications, GOI devices are feasible if the junction leakage can be reduced by optimizing the device structure.},

  abstract={We present a new framework for conducting controlled driving behavior studies based on multiuser networked 3-D virtual environments. The framework supports: 1) the simulation of multiuser immersive driving; 2) the visualization of surrounding traffic; 3) the specification and creation of reproducible traffic scenarios; and 4) the collection of meaningful driving behavior data. We use our framework to investigate the “rubbernecking” phenomenon, which refers to the slowing down of a driver due to an accident on the opposite side of the road, and its effect on the following drivers. The main contribution of the paper is the Scenario Markup Language (SML) framework, which is composed of: 1) the SML as a practical tool to specify dynamic traffic situations (e.g., an accident) and 2) the Scenario Control System to ensure the reproducibility of particular traffic situations, so that traffic engineers can obtain comparable data and draw valid conclusions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we specified the traffic accident scenario in SML and conducted a study about the rubbernecking phenomenon. We report on the results of our study from two viewpoints: 1) the reproducibility of the traffic accident situation (i.e., state variables of interest are recreated successfully in 78% of the cases); and 2) the interactive car-following behavior of human subjects embedded in the traffic situation of the virtual environment.},

  abstract={An application programming interface (API) is a feature that is available in some traffic simulation programs to enhance their capabilities by allowing users to customize changes in simulation such as driver behaviors, vehicle characteristics, user-defined control strategies, and advanced Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications. This paper presents an API in AIMSUN, which is a stochastic and microscopic simulation model, to evaluate a novel real-time signal control technique based on the dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. A transportation network of diamond interchanges is first created and calibrated in the AIMSUN environment. The API, which creates a dynamic link between the DP algorithm and AIMSUN, is then developed and deployed in C++. During simulation runtime, real-time traffic measurements, including vehicle counts and speeds, are provided by detectors in the network and fed into the DP algorithm that subsequently makes a decision on a signal control plan. The signal plan is then transferred back to and implemented in the simulated network, which emulates its actual operation. Extensive simulations have shown that the new signal control technique is superior to other common offline signal optimization tools in terms of handling the demand fluctuations. This paper has demonstrated that the API function is a useful tool to assess new ITS applications that are unavailable in simulation programs.},

  abstract={Serious games (SGs) are a practice of growing importance due to their high potential as an educational tool for augmented learning. However, little effort has been devoted to address student learning optimization in an SG from a systematic point of view. This article tackles this challenge by developing a learning-embedded attribute Petri net (LAPN) model to represent game flow and student learning decision-makings. The dynamics of learner behaviors in game are then addressed through the incorporation of learning mechanisms (i.e., reinforcement learning (RL) and random forest classification) into the Petri net model for knowledge reasoning and learning. Finally, an algorithm based on LAPN is proposed, aiming to guide learners to achieve a faster and better solution to problem-solving in game. The benefit of the proposed model and algorithm is then demonstrated in the SG Gridlock.},

After distilling the relevant principles from biology, their functional role in the implementation of an artificial system are explained. The resulting Agent, developed in an EU H2020 Research and Innovation Action, is used to concretely demonstrate the emergence of adaptive behaviour with a significant level of autonomy. Guidelines to adapt the same principled organization of the sensorimotor system to other agents for driving are also obtained. The demonstration of the system abilities is given with example scenarios and open access simulation tools. Prospective developments concerning learning via mental imagery are finally discussed.},

Results give insight on previously measured, yet inadequately explained, dynamic behavior of the BTG device. Further, problematic hysteretic behavior associated with the dynamic operation of the device with realistic body sheet resistance is described, suggesting design constraints on the maximum device width. Finally, a performance assessment of the BTG device configuration in ultra-low-power CMOS digital applications is offered and compared with FB and BTS, indicating that the optimal configuration is in fact application-specific.},

  abstract={We present a systematic investigation of device optimization for laterally diffused metal-oxide-semiconductor (LDMOS) field-effect transistors in terms of subthreshold leakage current, breakdown voltage, and ON-resistance for low-voltage (<; 10 V) power applications. We simulate and optimize n-channel 5-V LDMOS devices in order to reach a target leakage current and breakdown voltage. Device simulations and optimizations are performed by running an optimization algorithm, implemented as a computer code, on top of a commercial drift-diffusion simulation package. We find that n-channel LDMOS devices can realize leakage currents smaller than 10-13 A/μm while maintaining a breakdown voltage exceeding 10V for channel lengths down to 10 nm. Interestingly, we find an optimal ON-resistance for a channel length of 40 nm, while for shorter channel lengths the ON-state resistance increases with decreasing channel length. The increasing resistance for shorter channels is caused by electron mobility degradation as a result of an increasing body doping, needed to limit the leakage current. The optimal channel length presents a limit to conventional scaling of LDMOS devices, commonly used in low-voltage power applications.},

  abstract={Playing computer games is a popular recreational activity for young people. Creating a state-of-the-art commercial computer game is an incredibly difficult task. Writing a game like Pac-Man from scratch in a modern programming language is still difficult. Fortunately, several currently available tools make game creation easier. These tools can be used to create more complex games, but they offer only limited programming possibilities. Many similar packages exist. One such program is Game Maker, which is a rapid-application development tool. The Game Maker interface uses an object-oriented, event-driven approach. With Game Maker's drag-and-drop techniques, users can create games without writing a single line of code. But the program also includes an interpreted programming language. The program produces stand-alone games that can be distributed freely: a version of Game Maker, itself, is available for free as well.},

  year={2010},
  volume={38},
  number={8},
  pages={1794-1802},
  abstract={A novel modeling and simulation method for flux-trapping flux-compression generators (FT-FCGs) is presented, which utilizes PSpice circuit-simulation software to solve complex differential equations derived from circuit analysis. The primary motivation for the model development is the desire for a technique to rapidly design and prototype FT-FCGs for use as drivers in high-power microwave sources. The derivation of FT-FCG equations will be given, both in the ideal (lossless) and nonideal cases. For the nonideal case, three flux conservation coefficients are added to the equations to account for intrinsic flux loss in the circuit. Time-varying inductance curves are calculated using zero-dimensional models found in literature and adapted to fit this model. A simple FT-FCG design is used as an example to show the steps taken to complete a simulation. The same design was also fabricated and tested for comparison with predicted results from the model. A comparison of the waveforms acquired through simulation and experiment was found to result in good agreement for a given set of values for the flux conservation coefficients. A discussion of the derived equations, both lossless and nonideal, is given, as well as a discussion on the investigation of the impact of the three flux constants on the circuit. Analysis is offered on the results of this investigation, and conclusions are given on the effectiveness of this model to predict FT-FCG behavior.},

  abstract={Animal welfare has become an increasingly important concern in the sports field. Learning horse-drawn carriage driving requires much time and effort for both the drivers and the horses because the associated gestures to avoid harming the horses are difficult to acquire. This raises the need to develop realistic simulation environments for future drivers. To this end, two haptic interface prototypes were designed, coupled with dedicated simulation software. The first was developed based on a SPIDAR haptic device and implemented simple behaviors of the carriage. A user study demonstrated interest in such a simulator, which led to the design of a second prototype, on a different architecture than the first prototype, for integrating more precise laws of horse behavior such as mood and allowing a more subtle control of forces. An evaluation with driving learners revealed that the simulator was capable of not only producing sensations close to reality but also improving the interaction between the trainer and the learner.},

  abstract={In a complex three dimensional environment, the ability to climb across large gaps and obstacles is fundamental for a stick insect. The same ability is desired for a walking animat that operates in a similar habitat, In this study, the neural network simulation WALKNET that has been modelled on stick insect walking behaviour is used as a basis for the introduction of new behaviours that enable it to climb over large gaps. Gap crossing behaviour of stick insects has been studied to show which behaviours are most crucial for reaching the far edge. As slowing down of forward movement and searching movements of the front legs in the gap have been considered most important, these two behaviours have been analysed. Subsequently, new modules for velocity control, adaptation of swing amplitudes and generation of searching movements have been implemented into the WALKNET controller. With these innovations, the animat is able to climb across gaps of more than twice its normal step length, using similar strategies as the biological model. The new behaviours improve its adaptability and performance under challenging environmental conditions. Further results of experimental gap crossing studies are discussed with respect to their value for the walking simulation and robotic applications.},

  abstract={We studied the thermal and electromagnetic behavior of a conduction-cooled superconducting pulse coil. It was wound with a 4-strand parallel conductor composed of silver sheathed Bi2223 multifilamentary tapes and impregnated with an epoxy resin. We first investigated the temperature dependence of the thermal runaway current in dc operation. It was higher than the critical current by several tens amps at any temperature from 40 to 90 K. In order to study the mechanism of the thermal runaway, we carried out the numerical simulation of the coil behavior. We found out that the thermal runaway was caused when the heat generation at the winding end close to the cryocooler head where the flux-flow loss is the largest due to perpendicular magnetic field exceeded the cooling through thermal diffusion though the thermal runaway of the coil started at the other end of the winding. If the transport current is smaller than the thermal runaway current at the coil temperature just after applying current, the temperature distribution in the longitudinal direction of the coil varied into a monotonous gradient and the steady thermal flow was established. After that the coil temperature decreased to the balanced one},

We propose a novel formulation to blend input guidance fields to create singularity-free, goal-directed navigation fields.

  volume={17},

  pages={2422-2431},
  abstract={This article proposes a charging management of electric vehicles (EVs) that considers time anxieties and different behaviors of EV customers. The time anxiety concept is newly presented to address some uncertain events that may happen meanwhile charging of EVs, affect their charging patterns, and prevent them from meeting their energy demands. The working principle of the concept relies on prioritizing the charging before the event occurrences, and thus changing the EV charging patterns. Based on this concept, four different EV customer behaviors are proposed and their influences are investigated. The EV charging problem is formulated as a generalized nash equilibrium (NE) game, in which each EV minimizes its charging cost given its charging requirements and the charging facility constraints. The solution is developed on the basis of receding horizon optimization and reached iteratively in a distributed manner. Detailed simulation and comparison results are introduced to verify the effectiveness of the proposed charging management with the different time-anxiety-based EV customer behaviors.},

  abstract={Crowd analysis is very important for human behavior analysis, safety science, computational simulation, and computer vision applications. One of the most popular applications is video surveillance that plays an important role in crowd behavior analysis including real-time crowd behavior detection and information retrieval. In the field of video surveillance, many kinds of methods have been proposed for analyzing crowds, such as machine learning, signal processing, and physical model-based methods. As a kind of collective movements, crowd behavior contains many physical attributes, such as velocity, direction of motion, interaction force, and energy. Therefore, a lot of methods and models derived from physical ideas have been applied in many frameworks of crowd behavior analysis. This survey reviews the development of physical methods of crowd analysis in detail. The physics-inspired methods in crowd video analysis are summarized into three categories including fluid dynamics, interaction force, and complex crowd motion systems. Furthermore, the existing public databases for crowd video analysis are collated in this paper. Finally, the future research directions of the open issues of crowd video surveillance are also discussed.},

  title={Virtual center for renal support: technological approach to patient physiological image},

  volume={49},

  pages={1420-1430},
  abstract={The patient physiological image (PPI) is a novel concept which manages the knowledge of the virtual center for renal support (VCRS), currently being developed by the Biomedical Engineering Group of the University of Seville. PPI is a virtual "replica" of the patient, built by means of a mathematical model, which represents several physiological subsystems of a renal patient. From a technical point of view, PPI is a component-oriented software module based on cutting-edge modeling and simulation technology. This paper provides a methodological and technological approach to the PPI. Computational architecture of PPI-based VCRS is also described. This is a multi-tier and multi-protocol system. Data are managed by several ORDBMS instances. Communications design is based on the virtual private network (VPN) concept. Renal patients have a minimum reliable access to the VCRS through a public switch telephone network-X.25 gateway. Design complies with the universal access requirement, allowing an efficient and inexpensive connection even in rural environments and reducing computational requirements in the patient's remote access unit. VCRS provides support for renal patients' healthcare, increasing the quality and quantity of monitored biomedical signals, predicting events as hypotension or low dialysis dose, assisting further to avoid them by an online therapy modification and easing diagnostic tasks. An online therapy adjustment experiment simulation is presented. Finally, the presented system serves as a computational aid for research in renal physiology. This is achieved by an open and reusable modeling and simulation architecture which allows the interaction among models and data from different scales and computer platforms, and a faster transference of investigation models toward clinical applications.},

  abstract={Predictive control is a popular approach for further improving the efficiency and performance of vehicular systems enabling intelligent systems behavior appropriate to the driving situation. To calculate such control strategies, the future vehicle dynamics or subsequent states have to be predicted. We introduce a stochastic framework based on an explanatory model and stochastic processes to predict future vehicle dynamics with road network data. The distributions of the future states are approximated using sequential Monte Carlo simulation. The proposed approach enables stochastic forecasts incorporating uncertain driver behavior and available road data. Parameter inference is shown for exemplary real-drive test data, and predictive performance is evaluated using commonly used reference models. The results show that the explanatory model provides more specific information than time-series models do, still considering the uncertainty in the driver's behavior or the situation. The framework can be applied with predictive control algorithms enabling intelligent control of vehicular systems. Furthermore, the framework or parts of it may be usable for other applications like predicting behavior of traffic participants or general characterization of driver behavior.},

  pages={49359-49384},
  abstract={The paper explores the usage of agent-based modeling in the context of large event halls evacuation during music festivals and cultural events. An agent-based model is created in NetLogo 6.2.2 for better representing the human behavior when involved in such situations. A series of characteristics have been set for the agents in order to preserve their heterogeneity in terms of speed, age, locomotion impairment, familiarity with the environment, evacuating with another person, choosing the closest exit or not, selecting the closest path to the exits. An “adapted cone exit” approach has been proposed in the paper in order to facilitate the guidance of the agents in the agent-based model to the closest exit and its advantages have been proved in comparison with the classical “cone exit” approach. Different evacuation scenarios have been simulated and analyzed for better observing the capabilities of evacuation modeling in the case of evacuation emergencies. Besides the overall evacuation time, an average evacuation time has been determined for the agents based on the individual evacuation time, which can be easily connected with a risk indicator associated to each situation. Due to the visual interface offered by the agent-based model, coupled with the evacuation indicators, the proposed model can allow the identification of the main factors that may contribute to a prolonged evacuation process (e.g. overcrowding at one of the exits, not choosing the appropriate door, evacuating with a friend/parent) and the potential measures to be considered for insuring a safe evacuation process.},

  abstract={This paper describes a learning activity on computational thinking in ethics classroom with compulsory secondary school students (14-16 years old). It is based on the assumption that computational thinking (or better “logical thinking”) is applicable not only to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics subjects but to any other field in education, and it is particularly suited for decision making in moral dilemmas. This will be carried out through the study of so called “moral machines," using a game-based learning approach on self-driving vehicles and the need to program such cars to perform certain behavior's under extreme situations. Students will be asked to logically base their reasoning on different ethical approaches and try to develop a schema of decision making that could serve to program a machine to respond to those situations. Students will also have to deal with the uncertainty of reaching solutions that will be debatable and not universally accepted as a part of the difficulty, more ethical than technical, to provide machines with the ability to take decisions where there is no such thing as a “right” versus “wrong” answer, and potentially both (or more) of the possible actions will bring unwanted consequences.},

  abstract={With growing interest in the topic of smart computing and context-aware services, identifying driver's intention has become important in automotive industry. Among existing studies on driver assistance systems, few studies have used the concept of the levels of processing (LOP) to understand driver's information processing. This paper introduces experimental and computational studies that connect human behavior data to internal goal of a driver when an in-vehicle task involves visual search. In the case of consuming information displayed on a car instrument cluster, we considered two levels of information processing, perceptual and cognitive. Through an empirical study, we observed different human oculomotor behaviors that depend on the LOP by evaluating the reaction time (RT) and eye movement patterns. Further, we suggested different ways of information processing that can be represented as different routes in the underlying cognitive architecture of a queueing network. Simulation study demonstrated that trends in simulated oculomotor behavior were similar to those observed in the experiment, that is, RT at the cognitive LOP was shorter than that at the perceptual LOP, while eyes fixated for shorter duration and with lower frequency. In terms of application, this study reveals the possibility of using human-generated data for evaluating the innate purposes of drivers. Together with further development of sensors and invasive computing, the approach proposed in this paper could assist the realization of cognitive cars by understanding drivers' intent using eye tracking technology.},

  abstract={We introduce a framework for simulating a variety of nontrivial, socially motivated behaviors that underlie the orderly passage of pedestrians through doorways, especially the common courtesy of opening and holding doors open for others, an important etiquette that has been overlooked in the literature on autonomous multi-human animation. Emulating such social activity requires serious attention to the interplay of visual perception, navigation in constrained doorway environments, manipulation of a variety of door types, and high-level decision making based on social considerations. To tackle this complex human simulation problem, we take an artificial life approach to modeling autonomous pedestrians, proposing a layered architecture comprising mental, behavioral, and motor layers. The behavioral layer couples two stages: (1) a decentralized, agent-based strategy for dynamically determining the well-mannered ordering of pedestrians around doorways, and (2) a state-based model that directs and coordinates a pedestrian's interactions with the door. The mental layer is a Bayesian network decision model that dynamically selects appropriate door-holding behaviors by considering both internal and external social factors pertinent to pedestrians interacting with one another in and around doorways. Our framework addresses the various door types in common use and supports a variety of doorway etiquette scenarios with efficient, real-time performance.},

  abstract={Modeling individual and crowd behaviors is the basis for evacuation research, which is essential to reduce casualties under emergency conditions in large venues. This paper focuses on the pedestrian evacuation of large-scale venues with multiple exits, and proposes an improved pedestrian evacuation model which uses a novel dual-strategy adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm with affinity propagation clustering. Compared with the traditional models, the proposed model is demonstrated to have a better performance in simulating pedestrians' herding behavior in panic situations, especially when not familiar with the environment, as i) individual heterogeneity is considered and affinity propagation clustering is used in population division to simulate the process of people spontaneously gathering into swarms; ii) A dual-strategy updating scheme is designed to balance the cognition difference between the leaders and the agents in the swarm; and iii) Adaptive control of parameters is used to simulate the human-surrounding interaction and psychological fluctuates when the evacuees are moving towards exits. Numerical examples, which simulated the evacuation of a rectangle venue with multiple exits, demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed model. Moreover, the influences of pedestrian velocity, characteristics of exits, and leader movement on evacuation are analyzed. Experimental results show that the movement of leaders is different from other evacuees and the parameters of doors, such as width, quantity, and location all have a great influence on evacuation time.},

The rapid rise of educational escape rooms has led to a misalignment between educators’ needs for being able to implement this novel teaching practice and the availability of tools to ease the process. Moreover, this lack of support is preventing teachers and students from taking full advantage of the potential of educational escape rooms. This article provides a road map of the most urgent issues to be addressed to bridge the aforementioned gap: easing the creation of digital puzzles, aiding in the logistical aspects of conducting an educational escape room, harnessing learning analytics, fostering remote collaboration, and integrating artificial intelligence to adapt the experience to each team.},

  abstract={In this article, an electrothermal modeling approach of surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators and filters is presented. The starting point for the model is a preliminary design that has to be assessed for thermal aspects. Due to the high geometrical complexity of SAW components, simplifications are elaborated and qualified on resonator and filter levels to prepare the design for thermal simulation. A thermal model is created and simulated in a finite-element method environment. The simulated behavior is exported as a thermal impedance and implemented in a circuit model of a SAW filter. The layout's electromagnetic behavior is taken into account. Electrothermal models of the SAW resonators and the bus bars are developed. The interface to the thermal impedance is achieved by the use of electrothermal ports. The dynamic effect of the frequency shift is included. Verification is done by a comparison of the temperature increase of a resonator in a filter test structure to a corresponding simulation model. The filter is excited by a radio frequency large signal, and the temperature is detected by the use of a resistive temperature sensor. A simulation that shows the impact of mutual heating between the resonators in a filter environment is performed.},

  abstract={Cybersecurity simulation is a useful, practical approach to provide insights to counter cyber threats for organizations with a large-scale, complex cyber environment. From the micro behavior of malware on a host to the macroscopic impact of a DDoS attack, various phenomena can be observed and analyzed with simulation scenarios. Many platforms for cybersecurity simulation have been developed to support simulation scenarios and models with different fidelity levels: live, virtual, and constructive. Many platforms for cybersecurity simulation have been developed to support simulation scenarios and models with varying fidelity levels: live, virtual, and constructive. Hence, the support of interoperability between models with different fidelities remained untrodden in the cybersecurity simulation literature. In this paper, we propose a novel cybersecurity simulation platform, Cy-Through, which enables full interoperability between models with different fidelity levels, live/virtual and constructive models. Through the development and demonstration of a prototype of the platform, we prove the possibility of a Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC)-interoperable cybersecurity simulation.},
