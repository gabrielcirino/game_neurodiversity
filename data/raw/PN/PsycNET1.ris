N2  - A meta-analysis of 172 studies attempted to resolve the conflict between previous narrative reviews on whether parents make systematic differences in their rearing of boys and girls. Most effect sizes were found to be nonsignificant and small. In North American studies, the only socialization area of 19 to display a significant effect for both parents is encouragement of sex-typed activities. In other Western countries, physical punishment is applied significantly more to boys. Fathers tend to differentiate more than mothers between boys and girls. Over all socialization areas, effect size is not related to sample size or year of publication. Effect size decreases with child's age and increases with higher quality. No grouping by any of these variables changes a nonsignificant effect to a significant effect. Because little differential socialization for social behavior or abilities can be found, other factors that may explain the genesis of documented sex differences are discussed.

N2  - The purpose of this research was to investigate the relationship of fiction exposure and individual differences in morally relevant traits such as empathy, moral identity, and moral agency. Results from Study 1 were used to form hypotheses and specify statistical models for a preregistered second study. Relationships between moral constructs and three measures of fiction exposure (adult and young adult [YA] fiction and nonfiction) were tested with structural equation models (controlling for personality and gender). Associations between YA fiction and empathic concern, integrity, and moral agency were consistent across studies, as was that between adult fiction and moral permissibility. In line with theories of empathic simulation, empathy fully mediated the association between YA fiction and the sense of moral self. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - [Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 37(2) of Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes (see record 2011-08162-003). There was an error in Figure 3, which is described in the correction.] Four experiments showed that the preference normally established to a neutral flavor cue that was paired with maltodextrin was attenuated when that cue was conditioned in compound with another flavor—overshadowing. Furthermore, two experiments showed that the preference for a neutral flavor conditioned as part of a compound was further attenuated if the other element in that compound was separately paired with the reinforcer—blocking. These results stand in contrast to a number of previous compound flavor preference conditioning experiments, which have not revealed reliable cue competition effects. These discrepant findings are discussed in terms of the effects of within-compound associations and a configural perspective on potentiation. Modeling of this configural perspective predicts that a compound of two separately trained cues will elicit a similar response to the individual cues themselves—absence of summation. Two experiments confirmed this prediction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Recently, J. J. Starns and J. L. Hicks (2005) have argued that source dimensions are retrieved independently from memory (see record 2005-15992-004). In their innovative experiment, manipulating the retrievability of 1 source feature did not affect memory for a 2nd feature. Following C. S. Dodson and A. P. Shimamura (2000; see record 2000-08540-012), the authors argue that the source memory measure that Starns and Hicks used (known as the average conditional source identification measure) is vulnerable to a response bias in this particular paradigm, and this may undermine Starns and Hicks's conclusion. Starns and Hicks, however, acknowledged this possibility. The authors substantiate this claim by a simulation and by replicating Starns and Hicks's experiment. In 2 further experiments, the authors use an extended multinomial model to analyze data showing that Starns and Hicks's conclusion holds even if results cannot be attributed to response biases.

N2  - Automation is becoming ever more prevalent, with robot workers replacing many human employees. Many perspectives have examined the economic impact of a robot workforce, but here we consider its social impact: How will the rise of robot workers affect intergroup relations? Whereas some past research has suggested that more robots will lead to more intergroup prejudice, we suggest that robots could also reduce prejudice by highlighting commonalities between all humans. As robot workers become more salient, intergroup differences—including racial and religious differences—may seem less important, fostering a perception of common human identity (i.e., panhumanism). Six studies (ΣN = 3,312) support this hypothesis. Anxiety about the rising robot workforce predicts less anxiety about human outgroups (Study 1), and priming the salience of a robot workforce reduces prejudice toward outgroups (Study 2), makes people more accepting of outgroup members as leaders and family members (Study 3), and increases wage equality across ingroup and outgroup members in an economic simulation (Study 4). This effect is mediated by panhumanism (Studies 5–6), suggesting that the perception of a common human ingroup explains why robot salience reduces prejudice. We discuss why automation may sometimes exacerbate intergroup tensions and other times reduce them. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - A previous model of hippocampal region function in classical conditioning is generalized to H. Eichenbaum, A. Fagan, P. Mathews, and N. J. Cohen's (see record 1988-28895-001) and H. Eichenbaum, A. Fagan, and N. J. Cohen's (see record 1990-09261-001) simultaneous odor discrimination studies in rats. The model assumes that the hippocampal region forms new stimulus representations that compress redundant information while differentiating predictive information; the piriform (olfactory) cortex meanwhile clusters similar and co-occurring odors. Hippocampal damage interrupts the ability to differentiate odor representations, while leaving piriform-mediated odor clustering unchecked. The result is a net tendency to overcompress in the lesioned model. Behavior in the model is very similar to that of the rats, including lesion deficits, facilitation of successively learned tasks, and transfer performance. The computational mechanisms underlying model performance are consistent with the qualitative interpretations suggested by Eichenbaum et al to explain their empirical data.

N2  - This study investigated the effect of postnatal tactile stimulation (TS) on juvenile behavior, adult amphetamine (AMPH) sensitization, and the interaction of TS and AMPH on prefrontal cortical (PFC) thickness and striatum size. Pups received TS by stroking daily with a feather duster from birth till weaning and were tested, as juveniles, in behavioral tasks including open field locomotion, elevated maze, novel object recognition, and play fighting behavior. Development and persistence of drug-induced behavioral sensitization was tested by chronic AMPH administration and challenge, respectively. PFC thickness and striatum size were assessed from serial brain sections. The findings showed that TS rats spent less time with novel objects on first exposure but open field locomotion and elevated plus maze tasks were not affected substantially. TS reduced the frequency of play fighting and enhanced evasion in response to a playful attack, but only in males. The probability of complete rotation defense, leading to a supine posture during play, was reduced in both sexes. AMPH administration resulted in gradual increase in behavioral sensitization that persisted at least for 2 weeks. However, TS rats exhibited attenuated AMPH sensitization compared to sex-matched controls. Neuroanatomically, AMPH reduced the PFC thickness in control females but enlarged the posterior striatum in control males. TS experience blocked these effects. In summary, TS during development modulated the response to novel objects and altered social behaviors and attenuated AMPH-induced behavioral sensitization by preventing drug-induced structural alteration in the PFC and the striatum, brain regions implicated in drug abuse.

N2  - The article by Goodrich-Hunsaker and Hopkins (2010, this issue) takes up an important place among in the recent contributions on the role of the hippocampus in memory. They evaluate the effect of bilateral damage to the hippocampus on performance by human participants in a virtual 8-arm radial maze. The hippocampal damage appears to be highly selective and nearly complete. Exactly as with selective hippocampal damage in rats, the human participants showed a deficit in accurately choosing rewarded versus never-rewarded arms and a deficit in avoiding reentering recently visited arms. The results are triply significant: (1) They provide good support for the idea that the wealth of neurobiological information, from network to synapse to gene, on spatial memory in the rat may apply as a whole to the human hippocampal memory system; (2) They affirm the utility of human virtual task models of rat spatial memory tasks; (3) They support one interpretation of the dampening of the hippocampal functional MRI (fMRI) blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal during performance of the virtual radial arm maze observed by Astur et al. (2005). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Play fighting is a commonly reported form of play that involves competitive interactions that generally do not escalate to serious fighting. Although in many species what are competed over are the body targets that are bitten or struck in serious fighting, for many others, the competition can be over other forms of contact, such as sex, social grooming, and predation. In primates, the most detailed studies have been of species such as Old World monkeys, that engage in play fighting that simulates serious fighting, but reports of a number of others, especially among nocturnal prosimians, have noted that play fighting can also involve simulation of sex and grooming. The present study on captive born gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) provides a quantitative assessment of the relative engagement by juveniles in play fighting involving agonistic and amicable targets. About 80% of play fighting involves competing to groom or mount one another, with a minority involving competing to bite. That these forms of play fighting may be distinct from one another is suggested by the finding that attack on one target does not lead to counterattack on another. The findings are discussed in terms of the evolution and mechanisms underlying play fighting in primates and more widely among animals. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The cortex is not necessary for rats to engage in play fighting, but it is necessary for them to modify their pattern of play fighting in different contexts. Two experiments were conducted to determine the role of the motor cortex (MC). Rats with bilateral ablations of the MC performed on Postnatal Day 10 failed to show the normally present age-related modulation in defense but were able to modulate defense with different social partners. This latter finding was confirmed in rats given ablations as adults, in which responses to social status could be monitored before and after brain damage. It appears that different forms of cortical modulation of play fighting involve different cortical circuits. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Mental imagery involves the perceptual-like experience of an event that is not physically present, or detected by the senses. Fast and Blaisdell (2011) reported that rats use the representation of an associatively retrieved event to guide behavior in ambiguous situations. Rats were reinforced for lever-pressing during 1 of 2 lights but not both lights. They were then tested with 1 light illuminated while the second light was either covered by an opaque shield (ambiguous) or uncovered and unlit (explicitly absent). Rats lever-pressed less when the second light was covered compared with unlit, suggesting that a representation of the ambiguously absent light guided their behavior. However, Dwyer and Burgess (2011) offered an alternative mechanism in which the explicit absence of a cue gains associative value during training. Covering the light at test could effectively remove these associative properties, resulting in a generalization decrement of behavior. The current experiments were designed to test contrasting predictions made by these 2 accounts. Experiment 1 empirically established that generalization decrement can occur when an element of a compound cue is presented alone at test, but this decrement is attenuated, rather than enhanced, when the absent element is covered. Experiment 2 utilized a conditioned inhibition procedure to demonstrate that rat behavior during cue ambiguity is driven by an associatively retrieved representation rather than by generalization decrement. Collectively, the results argue against a purely nonrepresentational associative account of behavior and support a role for associatively retrieved representations in rats.

N2  - Little is known about the lived experiences of youth who belong to both the transgender and Asian communities in Canada. Existing literature on transgender identities tends to discuss identity formation from western perspectives, extrapolating from research with gay or lesbian, White individuals. Similarly, the research literature on developing ethnic minority identities, including Asian identities, tends to assume hetero-cis-normativity; consequently, the narratives and needs of youth with intersecting marginalized gender and ethnic identities tend to be obscured within these dominant and visible perspectives. The present study was an attempt at ameliorating erasure of this population by examining the lived experiences of eight Asian-Canadian transgender youth. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was utilized from a minority stress theory and intersectionality framework in order to advance understanding of otherwise invisible identities and the oppressive contexts in which marginalization is maintained. Semistructured individual interviews elicited three primary themes: (a) primacy of the experience of gender identity, (b) expression of identity, and (c) dominant scripts and lack thereof. Implications for service providers and future research are discussed, emphasizing the need to look at both “upstream” and “downstream” processes when working with multiply-marginalized populations in order not to privilege any one narrative over another.

N2  - Latent inhibition refers to retardation of the development of a conditioned response when the conditioned stimulus (CS) is preexposed alone prior to its pairings with an unconditioned stimulus. Experiment 1 demonstrated this effect for rats trained in an appetitive conditioning procedure and confirmed that the effect is found when the target stimulus is presented in compound with another or with a range of other stimuli during preexposure. Previous work has shown that a latent inhibitor does not reliably reduce the level of conditioned responding supported by an excitatory CS when the 2 stimuli are presented in compound (in a summation test). In Experiments 2, 3, and 4 we demonstrate that preexposure in which the target stimulus is presented in compound with a novel event on every trial will render that stimulus effective in a summation test. This outcome is uniquely predicted by the account of latent inhibition proposed by Hall and Rodríguez (2010), which suggests that the latent inhibition effect is a consequence both of a reduction in the associability of the stimulus and of a process of inhibitory associative learning that opposes the initial expectation that a novel event will be followed by some consequence.

N2  - This article briefly reviews 3 theories concerning elemental and configural approaches to stimulus representation in associative learning and presents a new context-dependent added-elements model (C-AEM). This model takes an elemental approach to stimulus representation where individual stimuli are represented by single units and stimulus compounds activate both those units and configurational units corresponding to each conjunction of 2 or more stimuli. Activity across these units is scaled such that each stimulus always contributes the same amount of activity to the system whether it is presented in isolation or in compound; the configurational units “borrow” activity from representational units for individual stimuli (and from each other). This scaling is affected by the extent to which stimuli interact with each other perceptually. Hence, the model is conceptually similar to Wagner’s (2003) replaced elements model but lacks features that explicitly code for the absence of stimuli (i.e., inhibited elements). Simulations of the model are reported for a range of generalization and discrimination learning tasks, conflicting results from which have previously been taken to provide support for either configural or elemental theories of learning.

N2  - Perceptual decision making involves choices between alternatives based on sensory information. Studies in primates and rodents revealed a stochastic perceptual evidence accumulation process that, after reaching threshold, results in action execution. Birds represent a cognitively highly successful vertebrate class that has been evolving independent from mammals for more than 300 million years. The present study investigated whether perceptual decision making in pigeons shows behavioral and computational dynamics comparable to those in mammals and rodents. Using a novel “pigeon helmet” with liquid shutter displays that controls visual input to individual eyes/hemispheres with precise timing, we indeed revealed highly similar dynamics of perceptual decision making. Thus, both mammals and birds seem to share this core cognitive process that possibly represents a fundamental constituent of decision making throughout vertebrates. Interestingly, in our experiments we additionally discovered that both avian hemispheres start independent sensory accumulation processes without any major interhemispheric exchange. Because birds lack a corpus callosum and have only a small anterior commissure, they seem to be forced to decide on motor responses based on unihemispheric decisions under conditions of time pressure.

N2  - It has been hypothesized that play is more likely to be present in larger brained species. We tested this hypothesis in mammals using independent contrasts, a method that controls for phylogenetic relatedness. Comparisons across 15 orders revealed that the prevalence and complexity of play was significantly correlated with brain size, with larger brained orders having more playful species. Three orders, Rodentia, Marsupialia, and Primates, were used for within-order comparisons among species and, where possible, among families. The comparisons were not significant for rodents or primates, and those for marsupials yielded inconsistent results. Therefore, although a strong relationship is present at the highest taxonomic level of comparison, it diminishes or evaporates at lower level comparisons.

N2  - Objective: Attentional biases (ABs) have been shown to develop in the context of substance use disorders. Relatively less focus has been paid toward the development of ABs in behavioral addictions such as gambling disorder (GD). Furthermore, the psychological predictors and moderators of AB in GD remain unknown. The present study addressed these empirical gaps. Methods: Fifty-two non-GD electronic gaming machine (EGM) players, 25 GD-EGM players, and 61 non-gamblers completed measures of gambling-related behaviors and cognitions (problem gambling severity, cravings, expectancies, motives) and substance use and mental health (alcohol use severity, depression symptoms). The relationships between these constructs and AB for EGM images were then assessed using a free-viewing eye-tracking paradigm. Results: Non-GD EGM players and GD-EGM players attended to EGM images significantly more than neutral images (with the largest AB for the EGM players with GD). For all EGM players, gambling expectancies regarding the negative emotional impact of gambling and alcohol use severity were associated with greater AB. For non-GD EGM players only, AB was moderated by the anticipation aspect of gambling craving and the self-enhancement aspect of gambling expectancies. Conclusion: The results provide further evidence that ABs develop in the context of excessive gambling and are associated with gambling and psychological variables. The findings support the incentive-salience theory of ABs in gambling and provide a rationale for the development of AB modification programs in the treatment of gambling disorder. Given the predominantly white sample, our results may not generalize to individuals of other ethnicities. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - We examined how different types of communication influence people’s responses to health advice. We tested whether presenting COVID-19 prevention advice (e.g., washing hands/distancing) as either originating from a government or scientific source would affect people’s trust in and intentions to comply with the advice. We also manipulated uncertainty in communicating the advice effectiveness. To achieve this, we conducted an experiment using large samples of participants (N = 4,561) from the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Malaysia, and Taiwan. Across countries, participants found messages more trustworthy when the purported source was science rather than the government. This effect was moderated by political orientation in all countries except for Canada, while religiosity moderated the source effect in the United States. Although source did not directly affect intentions to act upon the advice, we found an indirect effect via trust, such that a more trusted source (i.e., science) was predictive of higher intentions to comply. However, the uncertainty manipulation was not effective. Together, our findings suggest that despite prominence of science skepticism in public discourse, people trust scientists more than governments when it comes to practical health advice. It is therefore beneficial to communicate health messages by stressing their scientific bases. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Use of virtual teams in workplace environments is common, and in this study, we investigated the emergence of collective efficacy in virtual teams. Collective efficacy—a team’s shared confidence in their ability to meet its goals—is an emergent state that has consistently been found to positively relate to team effectiveness. However, much of the past research on collective efficacy has focused on static approaches, ignoring the inherently dynamic nature of the construct. Thus, the past research has neglected to fully address the emergent nature of collective efficacy, which involves consensus (i.e., sharedness or agreement) and a trajectory (i.e., growth or change in level) over time. These issues are addressed in the current investigation. Longitudinal data were collected from 3,644 individuals, comprising 665 virtual teams, that were participating in a 10-week business simulation activity. Using consensus emergence modeling and multilevel latent growth modeling, we examined the dynamic nature of the emergence and trajectory of collective efficacy over three time points during project completion. Overall, we found that both consensus and the level of collective efficacy decreased over time, but teams that demonstrated smaller decreases over time had stronger effectiveness. These findings suggest that collective efficacy is a key resource in virtual teams that needs to be managed over time in order for teams to have optimal effectiveness. Implications for theory, future research, and practice are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Object affordances play a major role in action expression: (a) providing opportunities to generate potential solutions to instrumental problems and (b) shaping and constraining the motor actions available to an individual. The playful manipulation of objects can facilitate individual acquisition of functional object-assisted actions through affordance learning. We tested the “object affordance” hypothesis in free-ranging long-tailed macaques. This hypothesis holds that the physical properties associated with stone size afford different stone-directed actions, in the context of stone handling (SH) behavior, a form of culturally maintained stone play from which stone tool use can emerge. We predicted that higher SH versatility (i.e., total number of different SH behavioral elements expressed) and higher duration of the SH behavioral element “Pound” would be associated with the manipulation of medium-sized stones, followed by small stones, and then large stones. Our data partly supported these predictions. Both medium-sized and small-sized stones afforded the highest SH versatility, and a higher duration of “Pound” than large stones. As expected, duration of “Pound” was higher with medium than small stones, but the difference was not statistically significant. Our results were consistent with Newell’s constraint model, which emphasizes the role of objects’ physical properties in limiting and enhancing the expression of actions directed to these objects. The relaxed selective pressures acting on SH behavior may enhance the expression of a range of actions directed toward stones of different sizes that could facilitate the emergence of instrumental solutions and may contribute to explaining the evolution of lithic technology in early humans.

N2  - Psychopathic personality disorder, or psychopathy, is a psychiatric diagnosis associated with callous personality traits and chronic antisocial behaviors. During the past 2 decades, psychopathy assessments have been routinely utilized to inform violence prediction, threat management, sentencing, parole, etc. However, recent empirical research has questioned the reliability and utility of psychopathy assessments, sparking concerns about the ethics of their use. The present contribution adds to this ethical discourse, arguing that forensic mental health practitioners should refrain from using psychopathy assessments because they violate two of the most fundamental ethical standards in their disciplines to “promote well-being” and “to do no harm,” traditionally labeled the principle of beneficence and the principle of nonmaleficence. Indeed, psychopathy assessments provide no clear benefit to the patient, and there are de facto and potential harms causally associated with their intended use, which are evidentially not outweighed by any significant social benefits. The article concludes by recommending a near-universal cessation of psychopathy assessments, a recommendation that is especially pressing due to the availability of alternative assessment strategies and the risk of professional–ethical sanctions.

N2  - Laboratory strains of rats are a commonly used subject to study play behavior. Recent research has shown that play in one laboratory strain of rat (e.g., Long-Evans hooded) differs in a number of ways from its wild counterparts. These findings suggest that domestication affects some aspects of play behavior. However, there are multiple strains of laboratory rats, which have been domesticated through different lineages all derived from wild rats and it cannot be assumed that all domestic strains are identical in their play. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the play behavior of three other strains of laboratory rats (e.g., Wistar, Sprague-Dawley, and Brown Norway). All strains were similar to each other as they all engaged in high frequencies of play, tolerated similar interanimal distances before initiating playful defense and displayed similar acrobatic capacities, suggesting domestication produces some common changes in play and other factors that influence play. However, strains differed significantly from one another in the use of tactics that promote bodily contact during play. Indeed, in this regard, some strains were more similar to wild rats than others, suggesting that some domestication-induced changes are either unique or more prominent in some laboratory strains than others. Such a mosaic pattern of transformation not only offers the possibility of using strain differences to characterize the genetic factors contributing to different facets of play, but also cautions researchers from making rat-general conclusions from studies on any one strain.

N2  - Associative treatments of how Pavlovian conditioning affects conditioned behavior are rudimentary: A simple ordinal mapping is held to exist between the strength of an association (V) between a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an unconditioned stimulus (US; i.e., VCS–US) and conditioned behavior in a given experimental preparation. The inadequacy of this simplification is highlighted by recent studies that have taken multiple measures of conditioned behavior: Different measures of conditioned behavior provide the basis for drawing opposite conclusions about VCS–US across individual animals. Here, we develop a simple model involving reciprocal associations between the CS and US (VCS–US and VUS–CS) that simulates these qualitative individual differences in conditioned behavior. The new model, HeiDI (How excitation and inhibition Determine Ideo-motion), enables a broad range of phenomena to be accommodated, which are either beyond the scope of extant models or require them to appeal to additional (learning) processes. It also provides an impetus for new lines of inquiry and generates novel predictions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - We examined the evidence for heterogeneity (of effect sizes) when only minor changes to sample population and settings were made between studies and explored the association between heterogeneity and average effect size in a sample of 68 meta-analyses from 13 preregistered multilab direct replication projects in social and cognitive psychology. Among the many examined effects, examples include the Stroop effect, the “verbal overshadowing” effect, and various priming effects such as “anchoring” effects. We found limited heterogeneity; 48/68 (71%) meta-analyses had nonsignificant heterogeneity, and most (49/68; 72%) were most likely to have zero to small heterogeneity. Power to detect small heterogeneity (as defined by Higgins, Thompson, Deeks, & Altman, 2003) was low for all projects (mean 43%), but good to excellent for medium and large heterogeneity. Our findings thus show little evidence of widespread heterogeneity in direct replication studies in social and cognitive psychology, suggesting that minor changes in sample population and settings are unlikely to affect research outcomes in these fields of psychology. We also found strong correlations between observed average effect sizes (standardized mean differences and log odds ratios) and heterogeneity in our sample. Our results suggest that heterogeneity and moderation of effects is unlikely for a 0 average true effect size, but increasingly likely for larger average true effect size.

N2  - Gender assessments are traditionally required before accessing gender-affirming interventions such as hormone therapy and transition-related surgeries. Gender assessments are presented as a way of preventing regret experienced by some people who reidentify with the gender they were assigned at birth after medically transitioning. This article reviews the theoretical and empirical foundations of commonly used methods and predictors for assessing trans patients’ gender identity and/or dysphoria as a condition of eligibility for gender-affirming interventions. We find that the DSM-5 diagnosis, taking gender history, standardized questionnaires, and regret correlates rely on stereotyping, arbitrary, and unproven considerations and, as a result, do not offer reliable ways of predicting future regret over-and-above self-reported gender identity and embodiment goals. This finding is corroborated by empirical data suggesting that individuals who circumvent gender assessments or pursue care under an informed consent model do not present heightened rates of regret. The article concludes that there is no evidence that gender assessments can reliably predict or prevent regret better than self-reported gender identity and embodiment goals. This conclusion provides additional support for informed consent models of care, which deemphasize gender assessments in favor of supporting patient decision making.

N2  - Commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers often multitask when driving to increase travel efficiency and to increase alertness. Secondary tasks have been shown to impact CMV driving differentially, and attentional resources have been posited as a key factor. However, underlying mechanisms of secondary task engagement on attention and task performance have not been fully examined. Additionally, it is unknown if attentional control moderates these differential effects of secondary tasks and task performance. The current study aimed to examine decrements in driving performance from a resource-control theory by determining the specific relation between attentional resources and attentional control. To achieve this goal, 2 objectives were determined. Objective 1 considered the differential impact of secondary tasks on attentional resources in CMV driving performance. Objective 2 investigated individual differences in attentional control in the sample of CMV drivers. Fifty CMV drivers (Mage = 39.8 years, SD = 8.36) completed the 10-min psychomotor vigilance task providing measures of attentional control and also drove in a CMV driving simulator 4 times while presented with 1 of 4 secondary tasks. Findings linked secondary tasks to attentional resources, which, consequently affected CMV driving performance. The mediating effect of attentional resources significantly differed among varying levels of attentional control. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - We report on operant conditioning and artificial neural network (ANN) simulations aimed at further elucidating mechanisms of black-capped chickadee chick-a-dee call note category perception. Specifically, we tested for differences in the speed of acquisition among different discrimination tasks and, in two selected discrimination groups, searched for evidence of peak shift. Earlier, unreported ANN data were instrumental in providing the motivation for the current set of studies with chickadees and are provided here. The ANNs revealed differences in the speed of learning among note-type discrimination groups that is related to the degree of perceptual similarity among the three note types tested (i.e., A, B, and C notes). In many respects, bird and network results were in agreement (i.e., in the observation of peak shift in the same group), but they also differed in important ways (i.e., all discrimination groups showed differences in speed of learning in simulations but not in chickadees). We suggest that the start, peak and end frequency of the chick-a portion of chick-a-dee call notes, which form a graded but overlapping continuum, may drive the peak shift observed.

N2  - Psychologists frequently use symptom validity tests (SVTs) to help determine whether evaluees' test performance or reported symptoms accurately represent their true functioning and capability. Most studies evaluating the accuracy of SVTs have used either known-group comparisons or simulation designs, but these approaches have well-known limitations (potential misclassifications or lack of ecological validity). This study uses latent class modeling (LCM) implemented in a Bayesian framework to estimate SVT classification accuracy based on data obtained from real-life forensic evaluations. We obtained archival data from 1,301 outpatient evaluees who underwent testing with the Computerized Assessment of Response Bias (CARB), the Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM), and the Word Memory Test (WMT) in a forensic evaluation context. Under various data models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods implemented via WinBUGS converged to target distributions that permitted Bayesian estimates of SVT accuracy. Under the most plausible model (conditional dependence in test results), classification accuracies (expressed as area under the “trapezoidal” receiver operating characteristic curve ± standard deviation) were as follows: CARB = 0.765 ± 0.030, WMT = 0.929 ± 0.020, and TOMM = 0.771 ± 0.034. At decision thresholds that hold false positive rates at 0.02, the SVTs would detect invalid responses (true positives) at rates of approximately 35%, 65%, and 49%, respectively, for the 3 tests. Though LCM methods have limitations, this study suggests that they offer an approach to SVT evaluation that avoids methodological pitfalls of known-group research designs while retaining ecological validity that is absent in simulation studies.

N2  - Early work on the nightmare protection hypothesis found that males who play combat-centric video games frequently did not experience nightmares in the same way as their counterparts. Rather, their dreams involved fighting back and feeling empowered. However, this effect did not occur for female high-end gamers in a follow-up study with students. The current study was conducted to explore this sex difference. It was hypothesized that the difference may be a result of in-dream coping responses, stereotype threat or preferred game genres. This study utilized an online survey containing 5 questionnaires to address the different hypotheses, including gathering a recent nightmare and coping response to this nightmare. Results, which are consistent with previous research, indicate that males and females are playing different types of video games. Males were playing more combat-centric games, which may be nightmare inoculating. For females, casual games may not be providing the nightmare protection as they do in males. No support was found for stereotype threat with the current measure. Early support was found for differences in waking and in-dream coping styles. Overall, continued evidence of sex differences in nightmare inoculations was found and some light was shed on what may be causing these differences.

N2  - Moderation analysis is used to study under what conditions or for which subgroups of individuals a treatment effect is stronger or weaker. When a moderator variable is categorical, such as assigned sex, treatment effects can be estimated for each group resulting in a treatment effect for males and a treatment effect for females. If a moderator variable is a continuous variable, a strategy for investigating moderated treatment effects is to estimate conditional effects (i.e., simple slopes) via the pick-a-point approach. When conditional effects are estimated using the pick-a-point approach, the conditional effects are often given the interpretation of “the treatment effect for the subgroup of individuals….” However, the interpretation of these conditional effects as subgroup effects is potentially misleading because conditional effects are interpreted at a specific value of the moderator variable (e.g., +1 SD above the mean). We describe a simple solution that resolves this problem using a simulation-based approach. We describe how to apply this simulation-based approach to estimate subgroup effects by defining subgroups using a range of scores on the continuous moderator variable. We apply this method to three empirical examples to demonstrate how to estimate subgroup effects for moderated treatment and moderated mediated effects when the moderator variable is a continuous variable. Finally, we provide researchers with both SAS and R code to implement this method for similar situations described in this paper. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The purpose of this study was to test the effects of playful physical contact as an establishing operation (EO) on correct academic responses for four-year-old preschool students with developmental disabilities who functioned at the pre-speaker and pre-listener levels of verbal behavior. Two males and one female served as participants who attended a publicly funded, private preschool outside a large metropolitan area. A multi-element design (alternating treatments design followed by an AB design) was used to test the effects of the establishing operation. The data were collected in seven acquisition programs and one performance program for each participant. The establishing operation consisted of experimenters' tickling, spinning, and hugging the participants as pre-instructional play for 10 seconds for every 10 learn units. The results of these data showed that an establishing operation was effective at increasing correct academic responding across all participants. In addition, Participants A and B emitted more mands for the playful physical contact during the pre-play sessions (mands were not measured for Participant C).

N2  - Five experiments examined the influence of partial reinforcement on serial autoshaping in 120 male pigeons. In Exp I, Group 1 received 2 sequences of events: A followed by B followed by food, or A alone. Group 2 always received the AB sequence, reinforcement being presented on 50% of the trials. Ss responded more rapidly during A in Group 1. Exp II replicated this finding and confirmed that it was not due to differences in the density of the conditioning trials. A similar outcome was observed in Exp III, which also indicated that the differences between the groups were not due to differences in the reinforcing properties of B. Results are interpreted in terms of J. M. Pearce and G. Hall's (see record 1981-02676-001) model of Pavlovian learning, which states that responding during A in Group 1 was high because this stimulus is an inaccurate predictor of its immediate consequences. Results from Exps IV and V support and extend this analysis. (17 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Respondents read a narrative depicting a drunk-driving offender seeking help for alcohol problems and were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 types of client motivation (autonomous motivation, compulsory treatment, or impression management) and 1 of 2 types of therapist motivation (autonomous vs. controlled motivation). Maximal treatment efficacy was expected when both client and therapist were autonomously motivated. Minimal treatment efficacy was expected when the client entered treatment only to manage impressions and when the therapist exhibited controlled motivation. Compulsory treatment undermined beliefs about client interest in treatment. Finally, autonomously motivated therapists were expected to be able to reverse expected negative outcomes for compulsory treatment and impression management clients. It was found that expectations about the efficacy of alcohol treatment were affected by the perceived motivation of clients and therapists.

N2  - In a series of 3 experiments on rats, 2 hypotheses were tested: (a) that damage to the orbital frontal cortex (OFC) would alter the socially relevant context for executing defensive responses but not their performance and (b) that damage done to the OFC in early infancy would produce more deficits in social behavior than similar damage occurring in adulthood. Bilateral or unilateral OFC damage in adult males did not impair their ability to defend themselves during play fighting and when protecting their food but did impair their ability to modify the pattern of defense in response to different partners. Rats that sustained bilateral damage at 3 days of age not only had deficits in partner-related modulation of defense but also exhibited hyperactivity in their play. The findings thus supported the proposed hypotheses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - A core question in social categorization research focuses on how children organize social categories. We examined whether 4- and 5-year-olds: (a) identify the social category membership of a person based on relational interactions between that person and a known category member; and (b) use these social categories to guide inferences about certain shared properties. Preschoolers (n = 229) were introduced to 2 novel social categories (comprised of diverse individuals), each possessing a distinct property (e.g., dancing vs. singing). During test trials, children witnessed members from each category direct helpful, harmful, or neutral actions toward ambiguous characters. In Experiment 1, when a member of a category exhibited helpful actions toward an ambiguous character, children inferred that the ambiguous character belonged to the same category as the helper. In contrast, when a group member directed harmful actions toward the ambiguous character, children inferred that ambiguous character belonged to the alternate category. In neither case did children extend category properties to the new member. In Experiment 2, category properties were introduced as mutually exclusive social conventions. Here, children used helpful and harmful actions to identify the social category of an ambiguous character and generalize the property. In Experiment 3, when social categories were introduced using only shared physical location and shared activity as a marker of category membership, children did not use helpful or harmful behavior to predict category membership. Together findings indicate that children can identify social category membership based on observed social interactions when meaningful category information is available.

N2  - In two experiments, human participants performed a causal judgment task that simultaneously comprised two reciprocal patterning discriminations and a biconditional discrimination. They learned both patterning discriminations more quickly than the biconditional discrimination. Postdiscrimination tests were used to identify participants who had, or had not, learned to apply the patterning rules, as well as participants who continued to expect summation when presented with two cues that predicted the same outcome. All groups were faster to learn the patterning than the biconditional discriminations. These results are inconsistent with models of stimulus representation that invoke configural representations (e.g., Pearce, 1987, 1994; Rescorla & Wagner, 1972) because these models solve biconditional discriminations more readily than patterning discriminations.

N2  - Objective: We conducted meta-analyses and meta-analytic structural equation modeling of longitudinal studies among cancer survivors to (a) quantify associations between psychosocial predictors and physical activity, (b) test how psychosocial predictors combine to influence physical activity, and (c) identify study, demographic, and clinical characteristics that moderate associations. Method: Eligible studies used a longitudinal, observational design, included a sample of cancer survivors, and measured both a psychosocial predictor at baseline and physical activity at a later time-point. Of 2,431 records located through computerized searches, 25 independent tests (N = 5,897) met the inclusion criteria for the review. Random effects meta-analyses and meta-analytic structural equation modeling were conducted. Results: Eight psychosocial predictors of physical activity were identified. Self-efficacy (r+ = 0.26) and intentions (r+ = 0.33) were the strongest predictors in bivariate analyses. The structural equation models included attitudes, injunctive norms, self-efficacy, intentions, and physical activity (k = 22, N = 4,385). The model with the best fit, χ2(2) = 0.11, p = .95, root mean square error of approximation = .00, comparative fit index = 1.00, Tucker–Lewis index = 1.00, indicated that all specified paths were significant. Intentions were the strongest predictor of physical activity (β = 0.27, p < .001), and attitudes and self-efficacy were strong predictors of intentions (both βs = 0.29, ps < .001). Few significant moderators were observed. Conclusion: This review indicates that self-efficacy and intentions are direct predictors of physical activity in cancer survivors. Further, attitudes and norms predict physical activity through intentions. Findings inform intervention development to increase physical activity engagement among cancer survivors.

N2  - Emotion regulation patterns are shaped, in part, by the quality of interpersonal interactions during early development. Given the important contribution of caregiver emotion socialization, parenting programs targeting these socialization practices represent an effective method of preventative intervention for childhood difficulties with emotion regulation. This review examines emotion socialization parenting programs that target the development of emotion regulation in young children aged 0–6. Through a systematic search of multiple databases, 1117 articles were retrieved for title, abstract, and full-text screening. After screening, 12 articles remained and were summarized using a narrative approach. Herein, we provide an overview of 3 main intervention frameworks: Tuning in to Kids (TIK), Parent-Child Interaction Therapy-Emotion Development (PCIT-ED), and Emotion Enhanced Triple P (EETP). Overall, these emotion socialization programs have demonstrated efficacy in their ability to improve parenting behaviors related to the coaching of young children’s emotion regulation; however, there has been limited examination of their effectiveness in promoting children’s emotion regulation. Future research is required to address this limitation, with rigorous parenting intervention studies incorporating valid assessments of children’s emotion regulation in order to promote children’s development of adaptive emotion regulation.

N2  - Whereas both human and animal lesion and human neuroimaging studies have implicated the hippocampus in memory for associations, some studies find preserved associative memory following hippocampal damage. Starting with a classic summed similarity model of item recognition, we can account for associative recognition without assuming a specific hippocampally-mediated associative process. We add one key assumption: that one item can influence activation of another item’s features. Feature-strength patterns, evaluated for each probe item individually, are then diagnostic of whether an item was paired with one item versus another. We suggest that feature-level inference, without explicit storage of associations, may play a critical role in associative recognition tasks.

N2  - Robert A. Rescorla changed how Pavlovian conditioning was studied and interpreted. His empirical contributions were fundamental and theoretically driven. One involved testing a central tenet of the model that he developed with Allan R. Wagner. The Rescorla-Wagner learning rule uses a pooled error term to determine changes in a directional association between the representations of the conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US). This learning rule predicts that 2 equally salient CSs (A and B) will undergo equivalent associative change when they are conditioned in compound (i.e., AB→US). Rescorla’s results suggested that this was not the case (e.g., Rescorla, 2000). Here, we show that these results can be reconciled with a model that uses a learning rule with a pooled error term once that rule is applied equivalently to all of the stimuli presented on a given trial, and the resulting reciprocal associations (directly and indirectly) contribute to performance. This model, called HeiDI, integrates several features of Rescorla’s research and theorizing while addressing an issue that he recognized required further analysis: how learning is translated into performance.

N2  - According to a recent theory (Hall & Rodriguez, 2010), the latent inhibition produced by nonreinforced exposure to a target stimulus (B) will be deepened by subsequent exposure of that stimulus in compound with another (AB). This effect of compound exposure is taken to depend on the addition of a novel A to the familiar B and is not predicted for equivalent preexposure on which AB trials precede the A trials. This prediction was tested in 2 experiments using rats. Experiment 1 used an aversive procedure with flavors as the stimuli; Experiment 2 used an appetitive procedure with visual and auditory stimuli. In both, we found that conditioning with B as the conditioned stimulus proceeded more slowly (i.e., latent inhibition was greater) in subjects given the B−AB sequence in preexposure than in subjects given the AB−B sequence.

N2  - Objective: Schizophrenia researchers have focused on phenomenological aspects of the disorder to better understand its underlying nature. In particular, development of personal narratives—that is, the complexity with which people form, organize, and articulate their “life stories”—has recently been investigated in individuals with schizophrenia. However, less is known about how aspects of narrative relate to indicators of neurocognitive and social functioning. The objective of the present study was to investigate the association of linguistic complexity of life-story narratives to measures of cognitive and social problem-solving abilities among people with schizophrenia. Method: Thirty-two individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia completed a research battery consisting of clinical interviews, a life-story narrative, neurocognitive testing, and a measure assessing multiple aspects of social problem solving. Narrative interviews were assessed for linguistic complexity using computerized technology. Results: The results indicate differential relationships of linguistic complexity and neurocognition to domains of social problem-solving skills. More specifically, although neurocognition predicted how well one could both describe and enact a solution to a social problem, linguistic complexity alone was associated with accurately recognizing that a social problem had occurred. In addition, linguistic complexity appears to be a cognitive factor that is discernible from other broader measures of neurocognition. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Linguistic complexity may be more relevant in understanding earlier steps of the social problem-solving process than more traditional, broad measures of cognition, and thus is relevant in conceptualizing treatment targets. These findings also support the relevance of developing narrative-focused psychotherapies. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Mental health professionals often use structured assessment tools to help detect individuals who are feigning or exaggerating symptoms. Yet estimating the accuracy of these tools is problematic because no “gold standard” establishes whether someone is malingering or not. Several investigators have recommended using mixed group validation (MGV) to estimate the accuracy of malingering measures, but simulation studies show that typical implementations of MGV may yield vague, biased, or logically impossible results. In this article we describe a Bayesian approach to MGV that addresses and avoids these limitations. After explaining the concepts that underlie our approach, we use previously published data on the Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM; Tombaugh, 1996) to illustrate how our method works. Our findings concerning the TOMM’s accuracy, which include insights about covariates such as study population and litigation status, are consistent with results that appear in previous publications. Unlike most investigations of the TOMM’s accuracy, our findings neither rely on possibly flawed assumptions about subjects’ intentions nor assume that experimental simulators can duplicate the behavior of real-world examinees. Our conceptual approach may prove helpful in evaluating the accuracy of many assessment tools used in clinical contexts and psycholegal determinations.

N2  - The communicative practice of pathography, or illness narratives, is emerging within the field of medical humanities. Pathography is a modality through which one may express their embodied experience of illness and their relations with the health care system. Offering voice and agency to the patient, pathography also holds potential as an empathy training tool for medical staff. Research is illuminating the ways in which illness narratives can act as a bridge between the lived experiences of the ill and the institutional treatment practices of the health care system. “Conversations With Buer” is an example of a personal illness narrative depicting the interaction between mental illness, gendered subjectivity, and health care services.

N2  - Narrative understanding has been identified as a primary mode of human thought that informs us about the nature, causes, and consequences of human actions and interactions and, as such, underlies social knowledge. The development of narrative thought was investigated by analyzing the structural complexity and social-psychological understanding displayed in the story compositions of 151 adolescents aged 10 to 18 years. A clear developmental progression was observed in structural complexity in terms of plot structure and the construction of flashbacks. Also observed was a clear developmental trend in social-psychological content from an intentional understanding of human behavior in terms of immediate feelings, thoughts, and goals to an interpretive understanding in terms of personal history, long-standing psychological traits, and broader contextual factors. Gender differences were also noted, with girls outperforming boys on some measures. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Although decorticated rats are able to engage in play, their play is abnormal in three ways. First, decorticates do not display the normal, age-related shifts in defensive strategies during development. Second, decorticates do not modify their defensive tactics in response to the social identity of their partners. Third, decorticates display a global shift in defensive tactics from more complex to less complex strategies. It has been shown that lesions of the motor cortex (MC) selectively produce the abnormal developmental effects on play, and that lesions of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) selectively produce the deficits in behavioral discrimination between social partners. In the current set of experiments, we demonstrate that lesions of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) produce the shift from more complex to less complex defensive tactics, while leaving intact the age-related and partner-related modulation of defensive strategies. Thus, we have evidence for a triple dissociation of function between the MC, the OFC, and the mPFC with respect to social play behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Changing nomenclature from "patient" to "consumer" was intended to empower persons seeking medical treatment, but this shift happened when medical consumerism—the consumption of increasingly discretionary, enhancing, and "lifestyle" services—was becoming more prevalent. This essay offers a narrative framework for understanding medical consumerism, discusses problems of differentiating one person's need from another's medical commodity, considers implications for the practice of family medicine, and finally seeks a way out of the desperation in which analyses of consumer society typically end.

N2  - Paired associates and serial list memory are typically investigated separately. An "isolation principle" (J. B. Caplan, 2005) was proposed to explain behavior in both paradigms by using a single model, in which serial list and paired associates memory differ only in how isolated pairs of items are from interference from other studied items. In the present study, 2 experiments identify a critical dissociation between the 2 paradigms, challenging this unified account. Specifically, forward and backward probes were highly correlated for pairs and less so for short lists (triples). The authors asked whether the isolation principle could quantitatively accommodate this type of dissociation. A simulation confirmed that a single model incorporating the isolation principle can adequately explain this and other dissociations, supporting the common processes view.

N2  - R. A. Rescorla (2000, Rescorla, 2001, Rescorla, 2002) reported that the associative changes undergone by 2 conditioned stimuli that are reinforced or not reinforced in compound depend on their initial associations. The results contradict the predictions of simple error-correction models but can be explained by models that incorporate a “constrained” error-correction rule. A model of classical conditioning presented by N. A. Schmajuk, Y. Lam, and J. A. Gray (1996) suggests that attentional mechanisms, acting during both compound training and testing, have an important role in producing those results. Moreover, the model suggests that those attentional mechanisms might obscure the evaluation of the associative changes undergone by the conditioned stimuli during compound training. Two experiments that differentiate our model from competing theories are proposed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Weight stigma in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal physical and mental health outcomes. Critical interpersonal networks (i.e., family, friends, and partners) may be a buffer to weight-stigmatizing experiences. However, they may themselves also be a source of stigma, which can then be a detriment to relationship quality. Pregnant individuals (≥ 13 weeks) completed a battery of questionnaires online that assessed experiences of weight stigma from close relationships during their pregnancy and again at 3 months postpartum. Quality of relationships was assessed at both time points via The Satisfaction with Family Life Scale, The Friendship Network Satisfaction Scale, and The Dyadic Adjustment Scale Short Form. Linear regression analyses assessed the association between each endorsed source and the relationship quality scores in pregnancy and postpartum. The sample included 471 respondents, and the majority indicated they had experienced weight stigma from close relationships during pregnancy (n = 398, 84.5%) and postpartum (n = 343, 72.8%). A significant negative association was found between weight stigma experienced by family and quality of those relationships in pregnancy (R² = 0.013, β = −0.995, p = .01). There was a significant negative association between weight stigma experienced by partners (R² = 0.018, β = −0.142, p = .002) and family (R² = 0.029, β = −0.177, p R² = 0.016, β = 2.510, p = .006). As these interpersonal networks are integral social support systems, population-level strategies to mitigate weight stigma and improve weight discourse in pregnancy and postpartum are needed.

N2  - By integrating previous computational models of corticohippocampal function, the authors develop and test a unified theory of the neural substrates of familiarity, recollection, and classical conditioning. This approach integrates models from 2 traditions of hippocampal modeling, those of episodic memory and incremental learning, by drawing on an earlier mathematical model of conditioning, SOP (A. Wagner, 1981). The model describes how a familiarity signal may arise from parahippocampal cortices, giving a novel explanation for the finding that the neural response to a stimulus in these regions decreases with increasing stimulus familiarity. Recollection is ascribed to the hippocampus proper. It is shown how the properties of episodic representations in the neocortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and hippocampus proper may explain phenomena in classical conditioning. The model reproduces the effects of hippocampal, septal, and broad hippocampal region lesions on contextual modulation of classical conditioning, blocking, learned irrelevance, and latent inhibition.

N2  - Our understanding of orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) function has progressed remarkably over the past decades in part due to theoretical advances in associative and reinforcement learning theories. These theoretical accounts of OFC function have implicated the region in progressively more psychologically refined processes from the value and sensory-specific properties of expected outcomes to the representation and inference over latent state representations in cognitive maps of task space. While these accounts have been successful at modeling many of the effects of causal manipulation of OFC function in both rodents and primates, recent findings suggest that further refinement of our current models are still required. Here, we briefly review how our understanding of OFC function has developed to understand two cardinal deficits following OFC dysfunction: Reversal learning and outcome devaluation. We then consider recent findings that OFC dysfunction also significantly affects initial acquisition learning, often assumed to be intact. To account for these findings, we consider a possible role for the OFC in the arbitration and exploration between model-free (MF) and model-based (MB) learning systems, offline updating of MB representations. While the function of the OFC as a whole is still likely to be integral to the formation and use of a cognitive map of task space, these refinements suggest a way in which distinct orbital subregions, such as the rodent lateral OFC, might contribute to this overall function.

N2  - One reason that older drivers may have elevated crash risk is because they anticipate hazardous situations less well than middle-aged drivers. Hazard perception ability has been found to be amenable to training in young drivers. This article reports an experiment in which video-based hazard perception training was given to drivers who were between the ages of 65 and 94 years. Trained participants were significantly faster at anticipating traffic hazards compared with an untrained control group, and this benefit was present even after the authors controlled for pretraining ability. If future research shows these effects to be robust, the implications for driver training and safety are significant. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Play signals are viewed as important means by which animals inform each other that bites, strikes, and throws that occur during play fighting are indeed playful rather than serious. One such signal is the open mouth play face that is common in primates and many other mammals. Unfortunately, as most play fighting involves biting, it can be ambiguous as to whether any instance of opening the mouth is performed to communicate playful intent or is simply a preparation for biting. In this study, open mouths co-occurring with the bared-teeth display (teeth-baring) in Tonkean macaques were used to assess the context in which facial gestures only relevant for signaling (i.e., teeth-baring is not necessary for biting) are used during play. Two predictions arising from the hypothesis that play signals are used to facilitate playful contact were tested: that the open mouth with teeth-baring should (1) be most frequent preceding contact, and (2) that it should be performed most often when bites are directed at orientations that is visible to the recipient. The data only partially support these predictions. The open mouth with teeth-baring is also frequently used when a monkey withdraws from playful contact. Moreover, it is associated with bites to body targets, such as the rump, that offer little prospect for detection by the recipient; this supports the possibility that play signals may sometimes be emitted not to communicate with the partner but with the performer itself. Thus, play signals serve multiple functions during play fighting. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - A series of experiments studied the amount learned about two food cues (A and B) whose presentation in a meal was followed by an allergy (+) in a fictitious patient. Participants were trained with A+ and C+ in Phase 1 and then with AB+ or AB++ in Phase 2. Subsequent testing revealed that BC was more allergenic than AD, showing that more had been learned about B than A in Phase 2. Participants were also trained with A+, then with AB+, and finally with AB++. The results of interpolating AB+ between A+ and AB++ training were consistent with the hypothesis that pretraining with Cue A selectively suppressed attention to its associate across the AB+ trials and, thereby, reduced the amount subsequently learned about B on AB++ trials.

N2  - Two groups of rats were trained for 50 days on different discriminations in a magazine approach paradigm. One group was trained with a negative patterning schedule and a positive patterning schedule concurrently: they received intermixed trials of A+, B+, AB-, C-, D-, CD+ (A, B, C, and D are four distinct stimuli; the plus sign denotes reinforcement with food, and the minus sign denotes nonreinforcement). The second group of rats was trained with the same four stimuli arranged as compounds and reinforced according to the biconditional schedule AB+, CD+, AC-, and BD-. The first group learned the positive patterning schedule much more quickly than the negative patterning schedule, but they learned the negative patterning schedule more effectively than the second group learned the biconditional schedule. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for models of stimulus representation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Laboratory rats have been widely used to study the development and neural underpinnings of play behavior. However, it is not known whether domestic rats play in the same way and at the same frequency as their wild counterparts. In this study, the play of juvenile rats from a colony of wild rats maintained in captivity was compared to that of a strain of domesticated rats (e.g., Long Evans hooded). Three predictions were tested. First, it was predicted that wild rats would incorporate more agonistic behavior in their play. This was not found, as in all cases, both the wild and the laboratory rats attacked and defended the nape during play, a nonagonistic body target. Second, because play is typically more frequent in domesticated animals than their wild progenitors, it was predicted that the wild rats should play less than the laboratory rats. This was found to be the case. Third, because wild animals tend to be less tolerant of proximity by conspecifics and tend to be more agile in their movements, it was predicted that there would be less contact between wild pair mates. This was found to be the case; data show that the play of laboratory rats involves the same target (i.e., the nape of the neck) and tactics of defense as those used by wild rats. However, the laboratory rats initiated playful attacks more frequently, and were more likely to use tactics that promoted bodily contact. These similarities and differences need to be considered when using laboratory animals as models for play in general. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Rhythmically bouncing a ball with a racket was investigated and modeled with a nonlinear map. Model analyses provided a variable defining a dynamically stable solution that obviates computationally expensive corrections. Three experiments evaluated whether dynamic stability is optimized and what perceptual support is necessary for stable behavior. Two hypotheses were tested: (a) Performance is stable if racket acceleration is negative at impact, and (b) variability is lowest at an impact acceleration between -4 and -1 m/s². In Experiment 1 participants performed the task, eyes open or closed, bouncing a ball confined to a 1-dimensional trajectory. Experiment 2 eliminated constraints on racket and ball trajectory. Experiment 3 excluded visual or haptic information. Movements were performed with negative racket accelerations in the range of highest stability. Performance with eyes closed was more variable, leaving acceleration unaffected. With haptic information, performance was more stable than with visual information alone.

N2  - John Launer's (see record 2006-12690-009) article significantly advances the reconciliation of British narrative- based medicine and North American narrative medicine. Launer offers a compelling demonstration of medicine as what he calls a story-making activity. He shows how physicians can create a space for storytelling in the medical consultation by structuring their questions to follow the patient's proposed story. This commentary develops Launer's distinction between psychodynamic and dialogical frameworks. In the latter, the clinical encounter is understood as a dialogue in which stories are called forth from within relations of storytelling. The importance of Launer's exemplary humility is underscored as essential to the clinical dialogue. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Backward blocking, unovershadowing, and backward conditioned inhibition are examples of retrospective revaluation phenomena that have been suggested to involve more than simple associative learning. Models of these phenomena have thus used additional concepts, for example, appealing to attentional effects or more elaborate learning mechanisms. The author shows that a suitable representation of stimuli, paired with a careful analysis of the discriminations faced by animals, leads to an account of these and other phenomena in terms of a simple elemental model of associative learning, with essentially the same learning mechanism as the R. A. Rescorla and A. R. Wagner (1972) model. The author concludes with a discussion of some implications for theories of learning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - How parents cope with stress as a couple (i.e., dyadic coping [DC]) is related to mental health problems in children. But little is known about DC within first-time parents and child mental health problems in early childhood. This study investigated subgroups in DC trajectories across the transition to parenthood (TTP) and examined subgroup differences in child mental health problems. Mothers’ and fathers’ self-report of positive and negative DC (n = 288 couples) at seven points of measurement (27th, 32nd week of pregnancy, 2nd, 14th, 40th week postpartum, 3- and 4-year postpartum) and children’s emotional and behavioral problems from parent report (4-year postpartum) were used. Latent class growth analyses revealed that over half of the couples experienced a moderate decline in positive DC across the TTP (58%), whereas only fathers reported a decline among the remaining couples (42%). Fathers with a partner who maintained their level of positive DC reported more child emotional and behavioral problems than fathers whose partners’ DC also decreased. Results for negative DC indicated two subgroups in which one partner maintained their initial level of negative DC (stable fathers: 10%, stable mothers: 23%), while the other increased. In most couples, both parents increased their negative DC (67%). Fathers reported more child emotional and behavioral problems if their negative DC increased across the TTP than if their negative DC remained stable regardless of the negative DC of their partner. The existence of different DC trajectory patterns needs to be considered in further research as well as prevention. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Players’ use of video games to cope with stress and anxiety may be an important etiological factor in video game addiction. The present research tests the hypothesis that people with greater anxiety and who use video games as a means of coping with that anxiety are more prone to video game addiction. The hypothesis was tested in 2 survey studies using undergraduate samples. Study 1 found that using video games as a means of coping with setbacks or stress uniquely predicted video game addiction symptoms, even after controlling for frequency of gameplay and other maladaptive coping mechanisms. Serial mediation analysis provided evidence that anxiety associated with mental illness may prompt greater use of video games as a coping mechanism, something which, in turn, is associated with greater video game addiction. Study 2 replicated this serial mediation model. Although limited in their ability to infer causal direction, the studies do suggest the importance of assessing the role of player motivation in future studies about video game addiction, which may help clinicians and media researchers better understand the etiology and potential treatment of video game addiction.

N2  - Temporal dynamics in attention bias (AB) have gained increasing attention in recent years. It has been proposed that AB is variable over trials within a single test session of the dot-probe task, and that the variability in AB is more predictive of psychopathology than the traditional mean AB score. More important, one of the dynamics indices has shown better reliability than the traditional mean AB score. However, it has been also suggested that the dynamics indices are unable to uncouple random measurement error from true variability in AB, which questions the estimation precision of the dynamics indices. To clarify and overcome this issue, the current article introduces a state-space modeling (SSM) approach to estimate trial-level AB more accurately by filtering random measurement error. The estimation error of the extant dynamics indices versus SSM were evaluated by computer simulations with different parameter settings for the temporal variability and between-person variance in AB. Throughout the simulations, SSM showed robustly lower estimation error than the extant dynamics indices. We also applied these indices to real data sets, which revealed that the dynamics indices overestimate within-person variability relative to SSM. Here SSM indicated less temporal dynamics in AB than previously proposed. These findings suggest that SSM might be a better alternative to estimate trial level AB than the extant dynamics indices. However, it is still unclear whether AB has meaningful in-session variability that is predictive of psychopathology. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The effects of large neighborhoods (neighborhood size) and of higher frequency neighbors (neighborhood frequency) were examined as a function of nonword neighborhood size in lexical decision tasks. According to the multiple read-out model (J. Grainger & A. M. Jacobs, 1996), neighborhood size and neighborhood frequency effects should vary systematically as a function of nonword neighborhood size. In these experiments, the nonword context was more extensively manipulated than in previous studies, providing a more complete test of the model's predictions. In addition, simulations were conducted examining the model's ability to account for the facilitatory neighborhood size and neighborhood frequency effects observed in these experiments. The results suggest that the model overestimates the role of inhibition in the orthographic processing of English words. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: The core clinical feature of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is recurrent intrusive memories of trauma. This study aimed to test a novel and simple intervention, inspired by the concepts of concurrent task interference and memory reconsolidation, to reduce the occurrence of intrusive memories among inpatients with complex PTSD. Method: In this open-label single case series 20 patients with longstanding complex PTSD in inpatient treatment monitored the occurrence of intrusive trauma memories (intrusions) over the course of their admission (5 to 10 weeks). Patients received study-specific intervention sessions (including a memory reminder for a specific intrusion then 25 min Tetris gameplay) on a weekly basis. A within-subjects multiple baseline AB design was used, in that the length of baseline (“A,” preintervention, monitoring only) and postintervention (“B”) phases varied within-subjects across individual intrusions. Further, some intrusions were never targeted by the intervention. The study was registered prior to analysis, ISRCTN34320836. Results: Frequency of targeted intrusions reduced by on average 64% from baseline to the postintervention phase. Conversely, never-targeted intrusions reduced in frequency by on average 11% over a comparable time-period. Of the 20 patients, 16 met our criteria for showing “response” to the intervention. Conclusions: Results provide initial evidence that this brief behavioral procedure might reduce the occurrence of intrusive traumatic memories in longstanding and complex PTSD, here delivered in an inpatient setting. The potential of this simple, focused intervention opens up new possibilities for tackling a core clinical symptom of PTSD, warranting further research.

N2  - A detailed description of the simultaneous type, serial token (ST²) model is presented. ST² is a model of temporal attention and working memory that encapsulates 5 principles: (a) M. M. Chun and M. C. Potter's (1995) 2-stage model, (b) a Stage 1 salience filter, (c) N. G. Kanwisher's (1987, 1991) types-tokens distinction, (d) a transient attentional enhancement, and (e) a mechanism for associating types with tokens called the binding pool. The authors instantiate this theoretical position in a connectionist implementation, called neural-ST², which they illustrate by modeling temporal attention results focused on the attentional blink (AB). They demonstrate that the ST² model explains a spectrum of AB findings. Furthermore, they highlight a number of new temporal attention predictions arising from the ST² theory, which are tested in a series of behavioral experiments. Finally, the authors review major AB models and theories and compare them with ST². (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Damage to the hippocampal system disrupts recent memory but leaves remote memory intact. The account presented here suggests that memories are first stored via synaptic changes in the hippocampal system, that these changes support reinstatement of recent memories in the neocortex, that neocortical synapses change a little on each reinstatement, and that remote memory is based on accumulated neocortical changes. Models that learn via changes to connections help explain this organization. These models discover the structure in ensembles of items if learning of each item is gradual and interleaved with learning about other items. This suggests that the neocortex learns slowly to discover the structure in ensembles of experiences. The hippocampal system permits rapid learning of new items without disrupting this structure, and reinstatement of new memories interleaves them with others to integrate them into structured neocortical memory systems.

N2  - The authors examined the validity of a method commonly used to test alternative hypotheses regarding the causes of comorbidity: the examination of underlying deficits of comorbid disorders. The authors simulated data in which the true causes of comorbidity were known, then compared the patterns of underlying deficits of the comorbid disorders found in the simulated data with the predicted results. The method of examining the underlying deficits of comorbid disorders could distinguish between several comorbidity models, including those that could not be distinguished well using other methods. The ability to distinguish the correct model decreased as the sample size and the correlation between the underlying deficits and the symptom scores decreased, suggesting that the issue of power should be considered carefully.

N2  - How do we apply learning from one situation to a similar, but not identical, situation? The principles governing the extent to which animals and humans generalize what they have learned about certain stimuli to novel compounds containing those stimuli vary depending on a number of factors. Perhaps the best studied among these factors is the type of stimuli used to generate compounds. One prominent hypothesis is that different generalization principles apply depending on whether the stimuli in a compound are similar or dissimilar to each other. However, the results of many experiments cannot be explained by this hypothesis. Here, we propose a rational Bayesian theory of compound generalization that uses the notion of consequential regions, first developed in the context of rational theories of multidimensional generalization, to explain the effects of stimulus factors on compound generalization. The model explains a large number of results from the compound generalization literature, including the influence of stimulus modality and spatial contiguity on the summation effect, the lack of influence of stimulus factors on summation with a recovered inhibitor, the effect of spatial position of stimuli on the blocking effect, the asymmetrical generalization decrement in overshadowing and external inhibition, and the conditions leading to a reliable external inhibition effect. By integrating rational theories of compound and dimensional generalization, our model provides the first comprehensive computational account of the effects of stimulus factors on compound generalization, including spatial and temporal contiguity between components, which have posed long-standing problems for rational theories of associative and causal learning.

N2  - This article reviews evidence and theories concerning the nature of stimulus representations in Pavlovian conditioning. It focuses on the elemental approach developed in stimulus sampling theory (R. C. Atkinson & W. K. Estes, 1963; R. R. Bush & F. Mosteller, 1951b) and extended by I. P. L. McLaren and N. J. Mackintosh (2000, 2002) and contrasts this with models that invoke notions of configural representations that uniquely code for different patterns of stimulus inputs (e.g., J. M. Pearce, 1987, 1994; R. A. Rescorla & A. R. Wagner, 1972; A. R. Wagner & S. E. Brandon, 2001). The article then presents a new elemental model that emphasizes interactions between stimulus elements. This model is shown to explain a range of behavioral findings, including those (e.g., negative patterning and biconditional discriminations) traditionally thought to be beyond the explanatory capabilities of elemental models. Moreover, the model offers a ready explanation for recent findings reported by R. A. Rescorla (2000, 2001, 2002b) concerning the way that stimuli with different conditioning histories acquire associative strength when conditioned in compound.

N2  - We describe a neurobiologically informed computational model of phasic dopamine signaling to account for a wide range of findings, including many considered inconsistent with the simple reward prediction error (RPE) formalism. The central feature of this PVLV framework is a distinction between a primary value (PV) system for anticipating primary rewards (Unconditioned Stimuli [USs]), and a learned value (LV) system for learning about stimuli associated with such rewards (CSs). The LV system represents the amygdala, which drives phasic bursting in midbrain dopamine areas, while the PV system represents the ventral striatum, which drives shunting inhibition of dopamine for expected USs (via direct inhibitory projections) and phasic pausing for expected USs (via the lateral habenula). Our model accounts for data supporting the separability of these systems, including individual differences in CS-based (sign-tracking) versus US-based learning (goal-tracking). Both systems use competing opponent-processing pathways representing evidence for and against specific USs, which can explain data dissociating the processes involved in acquisition versus extinction conditioning. Further, opponent processing proved critical in accounting for the full range of conditioned inhibition phenomena, and the closely related paradigm of second-order conditioning. Finally, we show how additional separable pathways representing aversive USs, largely mirroring those for appetitive USs, also have important differences from the positive valence case, allowing the model to account for several important phenomena in aversive conditioning. Overall, accounting for all of these phenomena strongly constrains the model, thus providing a well-validated framework for understanding phasic dopamine signaling.

N2  - In this article, we present a perspective on the role of the hippocampal system in generalization, instantiated in a computational model called REMERGE (recurrency and episodic memory results in generalization). We expose a fundamental, but neglected, tension between prevailing computational theories that emphasize the function of the hippocampus in pattern separation (Marr, 1971; McClelland, McNaughton, & O'Reilly, 1995), and empirical support for its role in generalization and flexible relational memory (Cohen & Eichenbaum, 1993; Eichenbaum, 1999). Our account provides a means by which to resolve this conflict, by demonstrating that the basic representational scheme envisioned by complementary learning systems theory (McClelland et al., 1995), which relies upon orthogonalized codes in the hippocampus, is compatible with efficient generalization—as long as there is recurrence rather than unidirectional flow within the hippocampal circuit or, more widely, between the hippocampus and neocortex. We propose that recurrent similarity computation, a process that facilitates the discovery of higher-order relationships between a set of related experiences, expands the scope of classical exemplar-based models of memory (e.g., Nosofsky, 1984) and allows the hippocampus to support generalization through interactions that unfold within a dynamically created memory space.

N2  - Classical conditioning data show that a conditioned stimulus (CS) can act either as a simple CS—eliciting conditioned responses (CRs) by signaling the occurrence of an unconditioned stimulus (UCS)—or as an occasion setter—controlling the responses generated by another CS. In this article, the authors apply a simple extension of a network model of conditioning, originally presented by N. A. Schmajuk and J. J. DiCarlo (S-D; 1992), to the description of these 2 different CS functions. In the model, CS inputs are connected to the CR output both directly and indirectly through a hidden-unit layer that codes configural stimuli. In this framework, a CS acts as (a) a simple stimulus through its direct connections with the output units and as (b) an occasion setter through its indirect configural connections via the hidden units. Computer simulations demonstrate that the network accounts for a large part of the data on occasion setting. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)
